Such lifetime income streams may have a term certain or other features to the extent permitted under rules prescribed by the Secretary. \u201c(ii) MODEL DISCLOSURE.\u2014Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of the Retirement Enhancement and Savings Act of 2018, the Secretary shall issue a model lifetime income disclosure, written in a manner so as to be understood by the average plan participant, which\u2014 \u201c(I) explains that the lifetime income stream equivalent is only provided as an illustration; \u201c(II) explains that the actual payments under the lifetime income stream described in clause (i)(III) which may be purchased with the total benefits accrued will depend on numerous factors and may vary substantially from the lifetime income stream equivalent in the disclosures; \u201c(III) explains the assumptions upon which the lifetime income stream equivalent was determined; and \u201c(IV) provides such other similar explanations as the Secretary considers appropriate. \u201c(iii) ASSUMPTIONS AND RULES.\u2014Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of the Retirement Enhancement and Savings Act of 2018, the Secretary shall\u2014 \u201c(I) prescribe assumptions which administrators of individual account plans may use in converting total accrued benefits into lifetime income stream equivalents for purposes of this subparagraph; and \u201c(II) issue interim final rules under clause (i).In prescribing assumptions under subclause (I), the Secretary may prescribe a single set of specific assumptions (in which case the Secretary may issue tables or factors which facilitate such conversions), or ranges of permissible assumptions. To the extent that an accrued benefit is or may be invested in a lifetime income stream described in clause (i)(III), the assumptions prescribed under subclause (I) shall, to the extent appropriate, permit administrators of individual account plans to use the amounts payable under such lifetime income stream as a lifetime income stream equivalent. \u201c(iv) LIMITATION ON LIABILITY.\u2014No plan fiduciary, plan sponsor, or other person shall have any liability under this title solely by reason of the provision of lifetime income stream equivalents which are derived in accordance with the assumptions and rules described in clause (iii) and which include the explanations contained in the model lifetime income disclosure described in clause (ii). This clause shall apply without regard to whether the provision of such lifetime income stream equivalent is required by subparagraph (B)(iii). \u201c(v) EFFECTIVE DATE.\u2014The requirement in subparagraph (B)(iii) shall apply to pension benefit statements furnished more than 12 months after the latest of the issuance by the Secretary of\u2014 \u201c(I) interim final rules under clause (i); \u201c(II) the model disclosure under clause (ii); or \u201c(III) the assumptions under clause (iii).\u201d.

this subparagraph but taking into account the rules of subparagraph (I)), \u201c(ii) after the date as of which the class was closed, any plan amendment which modifies the closed class or the

manner as nonelective contributions, including for purposes of applying the rules of subsection (l). \u201c(iii) PLANS DESCRIBED.\u2014A defined benefit plan is described in this clause if\u2014 \u201c(I) the plan provides benefits to a closed class of participants, \u201c(II) for the plan year as of which the class closes and the 2 succeeding plan years, the plan satisfies the requirements of section 410(b) and subsection (a)(4) (without regard to this subparagraph but taking into account the rules of subparagraph (I)), \u201c(III) after the date as of which the class was closed, any

(whichever is applicable). \u201c(D) DETERMINATION OF SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE FOR BENEFITS, RIGHTS, AND FEATURES.\u2014In applying subparagraph (C)(ii) for purposes of subparagraph (A)(iii), a plan shall

period\u2014 \u201c(i) the number of participants covered by such benefits, rights, or features on the date such period ends is more than 50 percent greater than the number of such participants on the first day of the plan year in which such period began, or \u201c(ii) such benefits, rights, and features have been modified by 1 or more plan amendments in such a way that, as of the date the class is closed, the value of such benefits, rights, and features to the closed class as a whole is substantially greater than the value as of the first day of such 5-year period, solely as a result of such amendments. \u201c(E) DETERMINATION OF SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE FOR AGGREGATE TESTING ON BENEFITS BASIS.\u2014In applying subparagraph (C)(ii) for purposes of subparagraph (B)(iii)(IV), a plan shall be

eligible to be aggregated and treated as a single plan solely by reason of having different plan years. \u201c(iii) Changes in the employee population shall be disregarded to the extent attributable to individuals who become employees or cease to be employees, after the date the class is closed, by reason of a merger, acquisition, divestiture, or similar event. \u201c(iv) Aggregation and all other testing methodologies otherwise applicable under subsection (a)(4) and section 410(b) may be taken into account.The rule of clause (ii) shall also apply for purposes of determining whether plans

participants satisfies the requirements of section 410(b)(2)(A)(i) (determined by applying the rules of paragraph (1)(I)), \u201c(iii) after the date as of which the class was closed, any plan amendment to the defined contribution plan which modifies the closed class or the allocations, benefits, rights, and features provided to such closed class does not discriminate significantly in favor

CONTRIBUTIONS TO CERTAIN OLDER, LONGER SERVICE PARTICIPANTS.\u2014In the case of a defined contribution plan which provides benefits, rights, or features to a closed class of participants whose accruals under a defined benefit plan have been reduced or eliminated, the plan shall not fail to satisfy the requirements of subsection (a)(4) solely by reason of the composition of the closed class or the benefits, rights, or features provided to such closed class if the defined contribution plan and defined benefit plan otherwise meet the requirements of subparagraph (A) but for the fact that the make-whole contributions under the defined contribution plan are made in whole or in part through matching contributions. \u201c(D) SPUN-OFF PLANS.\u2014For purposes of this paragraph, if a portion of a defined contribution plan described in subparagraph (A) or (C) is spun off to another employer, the treatment under subparagraph (A) or (C) of the spun-off plan shall continue with

(c) Definitions.\u2014For purposes of this Act\u2014 (1) USACCOUNT FUND.\u2014The term \u201cUSAccount Fund\u201d means the fund established under section 3. (2) USACCOUNT.\u2014The term \u201cUSAccount\u201d means an account established under section 4. (3) SECRETARY.\u2014The term \u201cSecretary\u201d means the Secretary of the Treasury or the Secretary\u2019s delegate. (4) USACCOUNT FUND BOARD.\u2014The term \u201cUSAccount Fund Board\u201d means the board established pursuant to section 7. (5) EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR.\u2014The term \u201cExecutive Director\u201d means the executive director appointed pursuant to section 7. SEC. 2. Findings. The Congress finds the following: (1) Americans recognize the importance of savings to create a more secure financial future for their family but barriers to entry have blocked participation in savings programs, leading to drastic disparities in asset building and wealth creation. (2) Most working families in America lack savings and face financial insecurity as a result. Forty-four percent of families are \u201cliquid asset poor\u201d, meaning they lack accessible savings to survive for three months at the Federal poverty level. (3) Of that number, over two-thirds of African-Americans (67 percent) could be considered \u201cliquid asset poor\u201d as are nearly three-fourths of Latinos (71 percent). (4) Families with children face additional barriers to building savings. These families are more likely than childless households to live in asset poverty. (5) There is a strong link between savings and economic opportunity. Children in the poorest fifth of households who manage to move up the income ladder as adults have almost ten times the wealth of those who remain at the bottom. (6) Children's savings accounts programs are evidence-based and have been tested throughout the country. In 2003, the Saving for Education, Entrepreneurship, and Downpayment (SEED) national demonstration project was established to evaluate the policy and practice of savings accounts for children. SEED found that even very low-income parents will save and invest for their children's future if given the opportunity. (7) In 2011, the city of San Francisco began offering child savings accounts, expanding them to all children enrolled in public kindergarten starting in 2013. Their experiment proves what SEED documented in 2003\u2014very low-income parents will save and invest for their children's future if given the opportunity. (8) Data from San Francisco\u2019s nascent Kindergarten to College Account program demonstrates that families, even those of lower income, are contributing their own funds towards their child\u2019s education at a rate of four times higher than Americans of all income limits are towards tax advantaged 529 college savings plans. (9) Even a small amount of children's savings can have a significant impact on college success, a key driver of economic mobility. Low- and moderate-income children with less than $500 saved for college are three times more likely to enroll in college and four times more likely to graduate than children with no savings. (10) Since the San Francisco program has been in existence, families have saved $5,200,000, helping build assets for participating families. (11) In order to expand economic opportunity and spur economic growth, the United States should promote savings and investments for all Americans. SEC. 3. USAccount Fund.

This Act may be cited as the \u201cInnovators to Entrepreneurs Act of 2018\u201d. SEC. 2. Findings. Congress finds the following: (1) The National Science Foundation Innovation Corps Program (hereinafter referred to as \u201cI-Corps\u201d), created administratively by the Foundation in 2011 and statutorily authorized in the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act, has succeeded in increasing the commercialization of Government-funded research. (2) I-Corps provides valuable entrepreneurial education to graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and other researchers, providing formal training for scientists and engineers to pursue careers in business, an increasingly common path for advanced degree holders. (3) The I-Corps Teams program is successful in part due to its focus on providing the specific types of education and mentoring entrepreneurs need based on the early stage of their companies, however the program does not provide similar support to them at later stages. (4) The success of I-Corps in the very early stages of the innovation continuum should be expanded upon by offering additional entrepreneurship training to small businesses as they advance toward commercialization. (5) The excellent training made available to grantees of participating agencies through the I-Corps Program should be made available to all Federal grantees as well as other businesses willing to pay the cost of attending such training. (6) The success of the I-Corps Program at promoting entrepreneurship within research institutions and encouraging research commercialization has been due in part to the National Science Foundation\u2019s efforts to date on building a national network of science entrepreneurs, including convening stakeholders, promoting national I-Corps courses, cataloguing best practices and encourage sharing between sites and institutions, and developing a mentor network. (7) As the I-Corps Program continues to grow and expand, the National Science Foundation should maintain its focus on networking and information sharing to ensure that innovators across the country can learn from their peers and remain competitive.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES February 27, 2018 Mr. Foster (for himself, Mr. Ryan of Ohio, Mr. David Scott of Georgia, and Mr. Polis) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Education and the Workforce A BILL To direct the Secretary of Education to carry out a STEM grant program. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the \u201cPartnerships for Progress and Prosperity Act\u201d or the \u201cP3 Act\u201d . SEC. 2. Findings. Congress finds the following: (1) As part of their Blueprint for Action researchers at Harvard Graduate School of Education and the Pathways to Prosperity Network recommend creating programs designed to \u201ccombine work and academic learning in post-secondary career preparation\u201d. In a follow-up study to the original \u201cPathways to Prosperity\u201d published by Harvard\u2019s Graduate School of Education in 2011, the same researchers released \u201cA Blueprint for Action\u201d in June 2014. (2) The Executive Office of Science and Technology Policy have explicitly stated a goal of strengthening America\u2019s STEM workforce. (3) According to a study by the Manufacturing Institute, a national survey of United States manufacturing executives found that 83 percent of American manufacturers reported a moderate or severe shortage of skilled workers. (4) The American Enterprise Institute further states that, \u201cAccording to the U.S. Department of Labor, the percentage of manufacturing workers aged 55 to 64 and the share of workers older than 65 have both significantly increased since 2000. Moreover, they also report that the median age of the manufacturing workforce increased from 40.5 in 2000 to 44.1 in 2011. The Society of Manufacturing Engineers predicts that the shortfall of skilled factory workers could increase to 3 million jobs by 2015 due to the aging manufacturing workforce and the resulting retirements of older workers, at the same time that an anticipated manufacturing rebound will increase demand for skilled workers.\u201d. (5) The 2012 Program for International Student Assessment found the United States below the average score of participating countries in mathematics and science. Furthermore, the United States has dropped in the rankings for mathematics achievement from 25th in 2009 to 36th in 2012. (6) NAE, along with other peer reviewed publications and studies from universities around the country have examined the benefits of partnerships between schools and outside organizations. Partnerships for Progress and Prosperity Act programs as well as experiential learning play an important role in training students for the jobs of the future. SEC. 3. Grant program.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. Short title and findings. (a) Short title.\u2014This Act may be cited as the \u201cSupporting the Teaching profession through Revitalizing Investments in Valuable Educators Act\u201d or the \u201cSTRIVE Act\u201d. (b) Findings.\u2014Congress finds the following: (1) States identified significant teacher shortages in their reports to the Department of Education during the 2015\u20132016 school year, with 48 States identifying shortages in special education, 42 identifying teacher shortages in mathematics, and 40 identifying teacher shortages in science. One reason for the shortages in these areas is because mathematics and science teachers can earn significantly higher starting salaries in the private sector. Further, rural communities face limitations in recruiting and retaining teachers for reasons such as funding issues, limited teacher supply, and geographic isolation. (2) Students in high-poverty and high-minority schools, both urban and rural, typically feel the largest impact of teacher shortages. These schools often experience difficulty hiring and high turnover on a regular basis, and they are the most severely affected when teacher shortages become widespread. This happens, in part, because inequitable funding of schools leaves many low-wealth urban and rural communities with inadequate resources, so they must pay lower salaries and typically have poorer working conditions. (3) According to a study by Mathematica, when high-performing teachers were offered large financial incentives to transfer to low-performing schools, their students\u2019 scores climbed 10 points in reading and 9 points in math compared to students statewide over 2 years. (4) According to a survey conducted by Scholastic, 97 percent of teachers list supportive school leadership as essential or very important for retaining strong teachers and improving student achievement, more than any other factor. (5) Research suggests that incurring postsecondary education debt can decrease the likelihood that high-achieving students, lower-income students, and students of color choose to work in lower-wage professions in general, especially in the education system. Therefore, loan forgiveness and service scholarships for teachers may be especially effective for recruiting teachers and school leaders from diverse, lower-income backgrounds. (6) According to the Learning Policy Institute, teacher loan forgiveness and service scholarship programs can be successful in both recruiting and retaining teachers. To be effective, these programs should provide a financial benefit that meaningfully offsets the cost of a teacher\u2019s professional preparation. This includes covering licensing and certification costs. (7) A 2015 Government Accountability Office study of Federal grant and loan forgiveness programs for teachers found that the structure of these programs matters. Further research shows effective loan forgiveness and service scholarship programs follow 5 design principles. These programs\u2014 (A) cover all or a large percentage of tuition; (B) target high-need fields or schools, or both; (C) recruit candidates who are academically strong, committed to teaching, and well-prepared; (D) commit recipients to teach with reasonable incentives to fulfill their commitment; and (E) are bureaucratically manageable for participating teachers, local educational agencies, and institutions of higher education. (8) The TEACH grant program under subpart 9 of part A of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070g et seq.) provides up to $16,000 in grants to prospective teachers who agree to teach in low-income schools and high-need subject areas for 4 years. This is far below the Department of Education\u2019s most recent estimate of the average annual cost of approximately $25,409 in tuition, fees, and room and board at the average full-time undergraduate 4-year institution. (9) The National Center for Education Statistics found that more than 2\u20443 of the individuals entering the education field borrow money to pay for their higher education. Teachers with a bachelor\u2019s degree have an average debt of $20,000 and teachers with a master\u2019s degree have an average debt of $50,000. Teachers also start out earning 20 percent less than their peers with comparable degrees who pursue jobs outside of education. These compounding factors can disincentivize prospective teachers from entering the profession. (10) In evaluating the TEACH grant program, the Government Accountability Office found that almost 2\u20443 of the requests for assistance under the program from October 2011 through March 2014 cited problems submitting certification paperwork. The Government Accountability Office recommended improvements in the program\u2019s design, including reducing burdensome annual paperwork, increasing awareness about the program, and streamlining the dispute process. (11) Spending by teachers on school supplies adds up to $1,600,000,000 nationally. According to the Education Market Association, most teachers spend around $500, with 10 percent spending $1,000 or more. (12) Teacher quality partnerships are designed to strengthen higher education-based teacher and school leader preparation. Studies show that teachers who are better prepared to enter the classroom stay longer and perform better than their underprepared peers. Teacher quality partnerships also fund programs like induction and mentoring that have been shown to increase teacher and school leader retention. Research indicates that the ongoing support for teachers provided by teacher quality partnerships, including mentoring and coaching, is an important part of early childhood education programs. (13) According to the Center for Education Data and Research, a more diverse teaching workforce leads to better student outcomes, particularly in high-poverty environments with significant at-risk student populations. Further, researchers from Vanderbilt University found that greater racial and ethnic diversity in the principal corps benefits students, especially children of color. Three commonly cited rationales for this benefit are\u2014 (A) students of color benefit from seeing minority adult role models in a position of authority; (B) the higher expectations that teachers of color tend to place on students of color; and (C) the effect of cultural differences between teachers of different backgrounds on instructional strategies and interpretation of students\u2019 behavior. (14) According to the report entitled \u201cEmpowered Educators: How Leading Nations Design Systems for Teaching Quality\u201d, effective teacher preparation successfully integrates theory and practice components. Further, according to the \u201cPreparing Teachers for a Changing World\u201d report sponsored by the National Academy Foundation, highly effective teachers vary in styles, yet have many teaching strategies in common. Research has identified a set of knowledge, skills, and dispositions essential for beginning teachers that should be incorporated into the teacher education curriculum. This includes the opportunity and capacity to reflect on and evaluate skills and to learn from practice. Evidence-based teacher preparation includes developing teacher skills, content knowledge, inquiry, and the capacity to provide effective learning experiences for a diverse set of students. (15) As it does in medicine, the Federal Government should maintain a substantial, sustained program of service scholarships or loan forgiveness programs that cover training costs in high-quality preparation programs at the undergraduate or graduate level for those who will teach in a high-need field or location for at least 4 years, as candidates are much more likely to remain in the profession and to make a difference for student achievement after 3 years of teaching. State governments can augment such an approach with programs targeted to specific local needs. (16) Research has shown the impact cultural competence can have on closing student achievement gaps and improving student outcomes by incorporating racial and ethnic minority contributions in curricula and diversifying pedagogical practices.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the \u201cSaving America\u2019s Pollinators Act of 2018\u201d. SEC. 2. Findings. Congress finds the following: (1) Pollination services are a vital part of agricultural production, valued at over $125,000,000,000 globally. According to a 2014 Presidential memorandum, pollinators provide for an annual amount of $24,000,000,000 to the economy of the United States and honeybees account for $15,000,000,000 of such amount. Similarly, pollination services of native pollinators, such as bumblebees, squash bees, and mason bees, contribute over $3,000,000,000 to the United States agricultural economy and are estimated to contribute between $937,000,000 and $2,400,000,000 to the economy of California alone. (2) One-third of food produced in North America\u2014including nearly 100 varieties of fruits and vegetables such as almonds, avocados, cranberries, and apples\u2014depends on pollination by bees. (3) Over the past several years, documented incidents of colony collapse disorder and other forms of excess bee mortality have been at a record high, with some beekeepers repeatedly losing 100 percent of their operations. The national honey crop reported in 2013 was the lowest in many decades. (4) A recent national survey sponsored by the Federal Government indicates that United States beekeepers experienced a 45.2 percent annual mortality rate with their hives during the period beginning in April 2012 and ending in March 2013. During the winter of 2013\u20132014, two-thirds of beekeepers experienced loss rates greater than the established acceptable winter mortality rate. (5) According to scientists at the Department of Agriculture, current losses of honeybee colonies are too high to confidently ensure the United States will be able to meet the pollination demands for agricultural crops. (6) Native pollinators, such as bumblebees, have also suffered alarming population declines. There are currently more than 40 pollinator species federally listed as threatened or endangered, and most recently, the iconic monarch butterfly has declined by 90 percent. (7) Scientists have linked the use of a certain class of systemic insecticides, known as neo\u00adnic\u00ado\u00adti\u00adnoids, to the rapid decline of pollinators and to the deterioration of pollinator health. (8) Neonicotinoids cause sublethal effects, including impaired foraging and feeding behavior, disorientation, weakened immunity, delayed larval development, and increased susceptibility to viruses, diseases, and parasites. Numerous reports also document acute, lethal effects from the application of neo\u00adnic\u00ado\u00adti\u00adnoids. (9) Conclusions from a recent global review of the impacts of systemic pesticides, primarily neo\u00adnic\u00ado\u00adti\u00adnoids, warn that they are causing significant damage to a wide range of beneficial invertebrate species, are a key factor in the decline of bees, and pose a global threat to biodiversity and ecosystem services. Another recent global review documented high levels of freshwater contamination. (10) Science has demonstrated that a single corn kernel coated with a neonicotinoid is toxic enough to kill a songbird. Peer-reviewed research from the Netherlands has shown that the most severe bird population declines occurred in those areas where neonicotinoid pollution was highest. Starlings, tree sparrows, and swallows were among the most affected. (11) In January 2013, the European Food Safety Authority determined that the most widely used neonicotinoids pose unacceptable hazards to bees, prompting the European Union to suspend their use on agricultural crops. (12) In June 2013, over 50,000 bumblebees were killed as a direct result of exposure to a neo\u00adnic\u00ado\u00adti\u00adnoid applied to linden trees for cosmetic purposes. (13) In February 2014, Eugene, Oregon, voted to ban the use of neonicotinoid pesticides on city property. Similar bans and restrictions have been enacted in Thurston County, Spokane, and Seattle, Washington, and Skagway, Alaska. (14) In June 2014, a Presidential memorandum established a Pollinator Health Task Force after identifying pollinator decline as a threat to the sustainability of food production systems, the agricultural economy, and the health of the environment in the United States. (15) In July 2014, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service announced plans to phase out neonicotinoid pesticides in all national wildlife refuges across the United States by January 2016. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service recognized that the prophylactic use of neonicotinoids for agricultural purposes harms a wide range of nontarget species and is therefore inconsistent with the management policy of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. (16) In October 2014, an assessment by the Environmental Protection Agency found that neo\u00adnic\u00ado\u00adti\u00adnoid seed coatings provide little benefit to overall soybean crop yield. Additional studies determined that in approximately 80 to 90 percent of row crop uses, neonicotinoid coatings are unnecessary. The prophylactic overuse of neonicotinoids violates the fundamental principles of integrated pest management. (17) In November 2014, the Province of Ontario, Canada, announced the province will move to restrict the use of neonicotinoid-coated corn and soybean seeds because of the broad harms from their overuse, with a goal of 80 percent reduction by 2017. (18) In September 2015, the Circuit Court of the United States for the Ninth Circuit ruled to revoke the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s approval for sufloxaflor\u2014a neonicotinoid pesticide. (19) In November 2016, Health Canada, the Department of the Government of Canada with responsibility for national public health, proposed a ban on almost all uses of the neonicotinoid imi\u00adda\u00adclo\u00adprid, saying it is seeping into Canadian waterways at levels that can harm insects and the ecosystem. (20) The President\u2019s budget for fiscal year 2018 cuts funding for pesticide review programs of the Environmental Protection Agency by 20 percent delaying reviews of new, potentially safer pesticides as well as reviews of older, more dangerous pesticides such as neonicotinoids. SEC. 3. Urgent regulatory response for honeybee and pollinator protection. (a) In general.\u2014Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall suspend the registration of imidacloprid, clothianidin, thiamethoxam, dinotafuran, and any other members of the nitro group of neonicotinoid insecticides to the extent such insecticide is registered, conditionally or otherwise, under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 136 et seq.) for use in seed treatment, soil application, or foliar treatment on bee-attractive plants, trees, and cereals until the Administrator has made a determination that such insecticide will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on pollinators based on\u2014 (1) an evaluation of the published and peer-reviewed scientific evidence on whether the use or uses of such neonicotinoids cause unreasonable adverse effects on pollinators, including native bees, honeybees, birds, bats, and other species of beneficial insects; and (2) a completed field study that meets the criteria required by the Administrator and evaluates residues, including residue buildup after repeated annual application, chronic low-dose exposure, cumulative effects of multiple chemical exposures, and any other protocol determined to be necessary by the Administrator to protect managed and native pollinators. (b) Conditions on certain pesticides registrations.\u2014Notwithstanding section 3 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 136a), for purposes of the protection of honeybees, other pollinators, and beneficial insects, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall not issue any new registrations, conditional or otherwise, for any seed treatment, soil application, and foliar treatment on bee-attractive plants, trees, and cereals under such Act until the Administrator has made the determination described in subsection (a), based on an evaluation described in subsection (a)(1) and a completed field study described in subsection (a)(2), with respect to such insecticide. (c) Monitoring of native bees.\u2014The Secretary of the Interior, in coordination with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, shall, for purposes of protecting and ensuring the long-term viability of native bees and other pollinators of agricultural crops, horticultural plants, wild plants, and other plants\u2014 (1) regularly monitor the health and population status of native bees, including the status of native bees in agricultural and nonagricultural habitats and areas of ornamental plants, residential areas, and landscaped areas; (2) identify the scope and likely causes of unusual native bee mortality; and (3) beginning not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act and each year thereafter, submit to Congress, and make available to the public, a report on such health and population status.", "115th CONGRESS2d Session H.

Senior coordinator for women and climate change.Sec. 202. Briefing and report. SEC. 2. Findings. Congress finds the following: (1) Women in the United States and around the world are the linchpin of families and communities and are often the first to feel the immediate and adverse effects of social, environmental, and economic stresses on their families and communities. (2) The United Nations has recognized, as one of the central organizing principles for its work, that \u201cno enduring solution to society\u2019s most threatening social, economic and political problems can be found without the full participation, and the full empowerment, of the world\u2019s women\u201d. (3) The United Nations Development Programme 2013 Human Development Report has found that the number of people living in extreme poverty could increase by up to 3,000,000,000 by 2050 unless environmental disasters are averted by coordinated global action. (4) Climate change is already forcing vulnerable communities in developing countries to face unprecedented climate stress, including water scarcity and drought, as well as severe weather events and floods, which can lead to reduced agricultural productivity, food insecurity, and increased disease. (5) Climate change exacerbates issues of scarcity and lack of accessibility to primary natural resources, forest resources, and arable land for food production, thereby contributing to increased conflict and instability, as well as the workload and stresses on women farmers, who are estimated to produce 60 to 80 percent of the food in most developing countries. (6) Women will disproportionately face harmful impacts from climate change, particularly in poor and developing nations where women regularly assume increased responsibility for growing the family\u2019s food and collecting water, fuel, and other resources. (7) Epidemics, such as malaria and zika, are expected to worsen and spread due to variations in climate, putting women (especially pregnant mothers and women who hope to become pregnant) and children without access to prevention and medical services at risk. (8) The direct and indirect effects of climate change have a disproportionate impact on marginalized women such as refugee and displaced persons, religious or ethnic minorities, adolescent girls, and women and girls with disabilities and those who are living with HIV. (9) Conflict has a disproportionate impact on the most vulnerable populations including women, and is fueled in the world\u2019s poorest regions by harsher climate, leading to migration, refugee crises, and conflicts over scarce natural resources including land and water. (10) Displaced, refugee, and stateless women and girls face extreme violence and threats, including\u2014 (A) being forced to exchange sex for food and humanitarian supplies; (B) being at increased risk of rape, sexual exploitation and abuse; and (C) being at increased risk for HIV, STIs, unplanned pregnancy, and poor reproductive health. (11) It is predicted that climate change will lead to increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather conditions, precipitating the occurrence of natural disasters around the globe. (12) The relocation and death of women, and especially mothers, as a result of climate-related disasters often has devastating impacts on social support networks, family ties, and the coping capacity of families and communities. (13) The ability of women to adapt to climate change is constrained by a lack of economic freedoms, property and inheritance rights, as well as access to financial resources, education, family planning and reproductive health, and new tools, equipment, and technology. (14) Despite a unique capacity and knowledge to promote and provide for adaptation to climate change, women often have insufficient resources to undertake such adaptation. (15) Women are shown to have a multiplier effect by using their income and resources, when given the necessary tools, to increase the well-being of their children and families, and thus play a critical role in reducing food insecurity, poverty, and socioeconomic effects of climate change. (16) Women are often underrepresented in the development and formulation of policy regarding mitigation and adaptation to climate change, even though they are often in the best position to provide and consult on adaptive strategies.

R. 4647 To amend the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act to make supplemental funds available for management of fish and wildlife species of greatest conservation need as determined by State fish and wildlife agencies, and for other purposes. IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES December 14, 2017 Mr. Fortenberry (for himself and Mrs. Dingell) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Natural Resources A BILL To amend the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act to make supplemental funds available for management of fish and wildlife species of greatest conservation need as determined by State fish and wildlife agencies, and for other purposes. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the \u201cRecovering America\u2019s Wildlife Act\u201d. SEC. 2. Findings. Congress finds the following: (1) A diverse array of species of fish and wildlife is of significant value to the United States for aesthetic, ecological, educational, cultural, recreational, economic, and scientific reasons. (2) More than 100 million citizens of the United States participate in outdoor recreation through hunting, fishing, birding, and other wildlife-dependent recreation, all of which have significant value to the citizens who engage in those activities and provide economic benefits to local communities. (3) It is in the interest of the United States\u2014 (A) to retain for present and future generations the opportunity to hunt, fish, observe, understand, and appreciate a wide variety of fish and wildlife; (B) to recover species of fish and wildlife listed as threatened species or endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) and to prevent fish and wildlife species from declining to the point of requiring Federal protection under such Act; and (C) to support collaborative and proactive conservation that will sustain the diverse fish and wildlife populations of the United States. (4) The first nongovernmental conservation organizations to instill fish and wildlife conservation values in hunters, anglers, bird watchers, and all citizens were founded during the 1880s to 1890s at the behest of hunters and anglers, including Theodore Roosevelt and naturalist George Bird Grinnell, who were alarmed that game and sportfish could not sustain unregulated harvest and that avifauna needed protection from commercial take. (5) At the turn of the 20th century, the States\u2014 (A) realized the need to regulate the harvest of game and sportfish for sustainable use; (B) required hunters and anglers to obtain licenses and established regulations for game seasons, bag and creel limits, and legal means of take for game and sportfish; and (C) used the funds received for such licenses largely for enforcement of such regulations. (6) In 1937, an alliance between hunters and conservation organizations, States, the Federal Government, and the shooting sports industry convinced Congress to transfer to the States receipts from an existing Federal excise tax on sporting arms and ammunition, matched by State hunting license dollars, for the management of wildlife and conservation of habitat under the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act (16 U.S.C. 669 et seq.), which greatly enhanced the States\u2019 ability to move from primarily enforcing game seasons and bag limits to science-based research and management of wildlife. (7) In 1951, an alliance between anglers and conservation organizations, States, the Federal Government, and the sportfishing industry convinced Congress to impose a Federal excise tax on fishing equipment under the Dingell-Johnson Sportfish Restoration Act (16 U.S.C. 777 et seq.) and to transfer to the States such receipts, matched by State fishing license revenues, to manage sportfish and conserve aquatic habitats, enhancing the State fish and wildlife agency\u2019s ability to use science-based research and management of fish species. (8) Such user-pay, public-benefits means of funding fish and wildlife conservation is unique in the world, having been started in the United States by sportsmen and sportswomen who were willing to pay these fees to ensure dedicated funds went to fish and wildlife conservation delivered by the States. (9) Such user-pay funds (licenses and excise taxes)\u2014 (A) have benefitted not only hunters and anglers, but all citizens of the United States by providing abundant fish and wildlife (including both game and nongame species), clean water, outdoor recreation, healthy activities, and quality of life; and (B) provide, and will continue to provide, a majority of the funds that are available to State fish and wildlife agencies for science-based research and management of fish and wildlife. (10) State fish and wildlife agencies are responsible for the conservation and management of all fish and wildlife in the State, but are grossly underfunded because there are few funds available at the State level for fish and wildlife conservation, except those driven by hunting and fishing license revenues and Federal excise tax revenues. (11) Congress created a subaccount known as the Wildlife Conservation and Restoration Subaccount under section 3(a)(2) of the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act (16 U.S.C. 669b(a)(2)) to support the full array of fish and wildlife conservation needs identified by State fish and wildlife agencies, including for species that are not hunted or fished, but only authorized appropriations for the Subaccount for one year. (12) While appropriated funds have been made available through the State and Tribal Wildlife Grants program of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the lack of assured and sufficient dedicated funding for the Wildlife Conservation and Restoration Subaccount has left unrealized the goals of the Subaccount, thereby allowing fish and wildlife populations to continue to decline across the United States and resulting in hundreds of species being listed as threatened species or endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.). (13) Under the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act (16 U.S.C. 669 et seq.), each State and territory is required to seek public input and produce a comprehensive fish and wildlife conservation strategy, otherwise known as a State Wildlife Action Plan, to guide the State-led conservation of the full array of fish, wildlife, and their habitats. (14) Providing assured and sufficient dedicated funding to the Wildlife Conservation and Restoration Subaccount will advance the national interest by assuring sustainable populations of fish and wildlife species are available for the use and enjoyment of citizens of the United States through implementing the comprehensive fish and wildlife conservation strategy of each State and territory. (15) As funds become available for the purposes of this Act, sportsmen and sportswomen expect States to secure the needed non-Federal match from sources other than revenue generated by sportsmen and sportswomen through the sale of State hunting and fishing licenses (except when projects or programs benefit habitat for species that are hunted or fished and other associated wildlife).

R. 4586 To provide for the National Academies to study and report on a research agenda to advance the understanding of albedo modification strategies, and for other purposes. IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES December 7, 2017 Mr. McNerney (for himself and Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology A BILL To provide for the National Academies to study and report on a research agenda to advance the understanding of albedo modification strategies, and for other purposes. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the \u201cGeoengineering Research Evaluation Act of 2017\u201d. SEC. 2. Findings. Congress finds the following: (1) Many significant scientific studies have concluded that the climate is changing. The Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found that even under the most stringent carbon constrained scenario, mean global surface temperature will still increase. (2) If unmitigated, continued rises in temperature will have severe impacts on human health, the global economy, and United States national security, damaging both earth and human systems. (3) Cutting carbon pollution is still the best way to mitigate climate change because it prevents further global temperature rise, whereas climate intervention is a higher risk reaction to already elevated greenhouse gas levels. (4) However, the United States and other nations may also need to consider climate intervention strategies, beginning with carbon dioxide removal and sequestration, including biological sequestration, and potentially extending to albedo modification. (5) In 2015, the National Academies published two reports that outline the research needs and ethical questions for climate intervention, addressing carbon dioxide removal and sequestration and albedo modification. These reports found that currently there is insufficient information to effectively evaluate, let alone deploy, strategies for large-scale climate interventions. (6) Many carbon dioxide removal options are relatively low risk and effective, but they are currently limited by cost and lack of technical maturity, and some may have significant local environmental impacts. Albedo modification shows evidence of being temporarily effective at cooling the planet, but at a currently unknown cost to and impact on the environment. (7) The Academies\u2019 reports recommended investing in the research and development of methods of carbon dioxide removal and disposal at scales that would impact the climate. They also recommended the development and implementation of a dedicated albedo modification research program that furthers basic climate science, understanding of human interaction with the climate system, and improved detection of changes in radiative forcing. (8) The Academies further recommended the development of a clear framework for governance of albedo modification research that would adjust governance of specified types of research according to the magnitude and nature of a project\u2019s expected impact on radiative forcing and climate. Such a structure should ensure transparency in the research process, extend governance requirements beyond those of general research, and engage civil society and other nontraditional stakeholders in decision-making. Large, high-risk projects should not be implemented without thorough consideration of the outcomes of smaller-scale, low-risk projects. SEC. 3. National Academies reports.

(2) The Tiahrt Amendments prevent the collection of valuable information, and the establishment of effective policies to prevent illegal guns from being used in crimes. (3) The Tiahrt Amendments impede enforcement of the gun laws by requiring most background check records to be destroyed within 24 hours, and by barring the Government from requiring annual inventory audits by owners of gun shops. (4) A 2012 study by researchers at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health found that the Tiahrt Amendments dramatically increased gun sales to criminals. (5) A 2016 study from the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health found that in 2008, 79 percent of all guns recovered by police from crime scenes belonged to someone other than the perpetrator\u201430 percent had been stolen. (6) A gun is stolen in the United States every 2 minutes. (7) Every year, nearly 115,000 Americans are shot. (8) In 2016, 38,658 Americans were killed with a gun. (9) In 2016, 289,223 firearms were recovered and traced in the United States, of which 211,384 were traced to a final retail purchaser. (10) Having effective policies to prevent illegal gun trafficking makes our families and communities safer. (11) Repealing the Tiahrt Amendments would support law enforcement efforts and give the public vital information needed to craft the most effective policies against illegal guns. SEC. 3.

This Act may be cited as the \u201cHire Our Heroes to Protect Our Schools Act of 2018\u201d. SEC. 2. Findings. Congress finds as follows: (1) According to 2016 data compiled by the U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights, only 24 percent of elementary schools and 42 percent of high schools nationwide have school resource officers. (2) The absence of school resource officers in many cases has been attributed to the lack of financial resources or the availability of trained police officers to fulfill the role of school resource officers. (3) No one is better trained and better equipped to handle a potential school shooting situation, and therefore serve as a school resource officer, than our Nation\u2019s men and women in law enforcement, including retired officers and veterans. (4) In many cases, police officers and veterans retire in their early fifties, while they still have a number of years where they can provide a valuable service to our schools and communities by serving as a school resources officer. (5) Placing highly trained and professional retired police officers and veterans in our schools as school resource officers is one of the easiest ways to bolster school security, and it can be achieved almost immediately.

R. 5322 To amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for a national program to conduct and support activities toward the goal of significantly reducing the number of cases of overweight and obesity among individuals in the United States. IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES March 15, 2018 Ms. Norton introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce A BILL To amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for a national program to conduct and support activities toward the goal of significantly reducing the number of cases of overweight and obesity among individuals in the United States. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the \u201cPromoting Healthier Lifelong Improvements in Food and Exercise Act of 2018\u201d or the \u201cLIFE Act\u201d. SEC. 2. Findings. The Congress finds as follows: (1) Currently, 69 percent of adults in the United States are overweight and 78.6 million (more than one-third of the adult population in the United States) are obese. (2) Data from two National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys show that, the prevalence of obesity among adults increased from 15.0 percent in 1976\u20131980 to 35.3 percent in 2011\u20132012. (3) In 2011\u20132012, more than 12,700,000 children and adolescents (or 17 percent) were overweight, and more than 78,600,000 adults (or 34.9 percent) were obese. Almost 6 percent of adults were extremely obese. (4) The percentage of children who are obese has more than doubled and among adolescents the percentage has more than tripled. Since 1980, the obesity rate for adolescents increased from 5 percent to 17 percent. (5) Approximately 48 percent of adults in the United States do not meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Physical Activity Guidelines, and national data show an increase in the calorie consumption of adults. (6) The rising rates of obesity portend greater disease and health conditions including hypertension, high total cholesterol, Type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, gallbladder disease, osteoporosis, sleep apnea, respiratory problems, and some cancers, such as endometrial, breast, and colon cancer. (7) Many underlying factors have been linked to the increase in obesity, such as increasing portion sizes, eating out more often, increased consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks, increasing television, computer, and electronic gaming time, changing labor markets, and fear of crime, which prevents outdoor exercise. (8) Chronic diseases account for 1.7 million, or 70 percent, of all deaths in the United States each year. Although chronic diseases are among the most common and costly health problems, they are also among the most preventable. Adopting a healthy lifestyle, such as eating nutritious foods and engaging in physical activity, can prevent or control the devastating effects of these diseases. (9) In 2008, overall medical costs related to obesity for United States adults were estimated to be as high as $147 billion. People who were obese had medical costs that were on average $1,429 higher than the cost for people of normal body weight. SEC. 3. Reduction in prevalence of overweight and obesity. Part B of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 243 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 317T the following section: \u201cSEC. 317U.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES March 13, 2018 Ms. Titus introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Education and the Workforce, and in addition to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned A BILL To make demonstration grants to eligible local educational agencies or consortia of eligible local educational agencies for the purpose of increasing the numbers of school nurses in public elementary schools and secondary schools. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the \u201cNurses for Under-Resourced Schools Everywhere Act\u201d or the \u201cNURSE Act\u201d. SEC. 2. Findings. Congress finds the following: (1) The National Association of School Nurses identifies schools as primary locations to address student health issues, since a school nurse is the health care provider that many students see on the most regular basis. (2) The American Academy of Pediatrics has recognized the crucial role that school nurses play in children\u2019s health and has called for having a full-time school nurse every day and in every school building. (3) The school nurse functions as the leader and coordinator of the school health services team, including by carrying out chronic disease management and health promotion as well as facilitating access to a medical home for each child and supporting academic achievement. (4) School nurses promote wellness and disease prevention to improve health outcomes for our Nation\u2019s children. In addition, school nurses perform early intervention services such as periodic assessments for vision, hearing, and dental problems, in an effort to remove barriers to learning. (5) The American Federation of Teachers has called for a nurse in every school, as nurses are front-line workers that address an array of health needs and their presence in a school can help to improve student learning. (6) According to 2017 data from the National Association of School Nurses, only 39.3 percent of schools employ a full-time school nurse, while 35.5 percent of schools employ a school nurse only part-time, and 25.2 percent do not have a school nurse at all. (7) The National Association of School Nurses has reported that medication administration to students is one of the most common health-related activities performed in school. As more chronically ill and medically unstable children enter the school system each year, the medical factors that promote and support their academic success increase, including the need for medications that enhance overall health or stabilize chronic conditions. (8) National data indicate that between 15 and 20 percent of children who spend their day in school have a chronic health condition. (9) According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, students today face increased social and emotional issues, which enhance the need for preventive services and interventions for acute and chronic health issues. School nurses are actively engaged members of school-based mental health teams and spend nearly 32 percent of their time providing mental health services, including universal and targeted interventions, screenings to identify early warning signs and provide referrals to medical providers, and crisis planning. (10) According to the Department of Education, during the 2013\u20132014 school year, 1,360,747 children enrolled in public schools experienced homelessness. Homeless children develop increased rates of acute and chronic health conditions, and the stress of their living situation can negatively affect their development and ability to learn. As a result, schools have become the primary access to health care for many children and adolescents. School nurses serve on the front lines as a safety net for the Nation\u2019s most vulnerable children. (11) Communicable and infectious diseases account for millions of school days lost each year. Data illustrate that when students have access to a registered nurse in school, immunization rates increase. SEC. 3. Increasing the number of school nurses.

R. 5160 To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide for coverage of cancer care planning and coordination under the Medicare program. IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES March 5, 2018 Mr. DeSaulnier (for himself and Mr. Poe of Texas) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce, and in addition to the Committee on Ways and Means, for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned A BILL To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide for coverage of cancer care planning and coordination under the Medicare program. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. Short title. (a) Short title.\u2014This Act may be cited as the \u201cCancer Care Planning and Communications Act of 2018\u201d. (b) Findings.\u2014Congress makes the following findings: (1) Cancer care in the United States is often described as the best in the world because patients have access to many treatment options, including cutting-edge therapies that save lives and improve the quality of life. (2) Access to the best treatment options is not equal across all populations and in all communities. The 1999 Institute of Medicine report entitled \u201cThe Unequal Burden of Cancer\u201d found that low-income people often lack access to adequate cancer care and that ethnic minorities have not benefitted fully from cancer treatment advances. (3) In addition, despite access to high-quality treatment options for many, individuals with cancer often do not have access to a cancer care system that incorporates shared decision-making and the coordination of all elements of care. (4) Cancer survivors often experience the under-diagnosis and under-treatment of the symptoms of cancer and side effects of cancer treatment, a problem that begins at the time of diagnosis and may become more severe with disease progression and at the end of life. The failure to treat the symptoms, side effects, and late effects of cancer and cancer treatment may have a serious adverse impact on the health, survival, well-being, and quality of life of cancer survivors. (5) Individuals with cancer often do not participate in a shared decision-making process that considers all treatment options and do not benefit from coordination of all elements of active treatment and palliative care. (6) Quality cancer care should incorporate access to psychosocial services and management of the symptoms of cancer and the symptoms of cancer treatment, including pain, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and depression. (7) Quality cancer care should include a means for engaging cancer survivors in a shared decision-making process that produces a comprehensive care summary and a plan for follow-up care after primary treatment to ensure that cancer survivors have access to follow-up monitoring and treatment of possible late effects of cancer and cancer treatment, including appropriate psychosocial services. (8) The Institute of Medicine report entitled \u201cEnsuring Quality Cancer Care\u201d described the elements of quality care for an individual with cancer to include\u2014 (A) the development of initial treatment recommendations by an experienced health care provider; (B) the development of a plan for the course of treatment of the individual and communication of the plan to the individual; (C) access to the resources necessary to implement the course of treatment; (D) access to high-quality clinical trials; (E) a mechanism to coordinate services for the treatment of the individual; and (F) psychosocial support services and compassionate care for the individual. (9) In its report \u201cFrom Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivor: Lost in Transition\u201d, the Institute of Medicine recommended that individuals with cancer completing primary treatment be provided a comprehensive summary of their care along with a follow-up survivorship plan of treatment. (10) In \u201cCancer Care for the Whole Patient\u201d, the Institute of Medicine stated that the development of a plan that includes biomedical and psychosocial care should be a standard for quality cancer care in any quality measurement system. (11) The Commission on Cancer has encouraged survivorship care planning by making the development of such plans for patients one of the standards of accreditation for cancer care providers, but cancer care professionals report difficulties completing the plans. (12) Because more than half of all cancer diagnoses occur among elderly Medicare beneficiaries, addressing cancer care inadequacies through Medicare reforms will provide benefits to millions of Americans. Providing Medicare beneficiaries more routine access to cancer care plans and survivorship care plans is a key to shared decisionmaking and better coordination of care. (13) Important payment and delivery reforms that incorporate cancer care planning and coordination are already being tested in the Medicare program; the Oncology Care Model has been implemented in a number of oncology practices, and additional models that will include care planning have been proposed. (14) The alternative payment models, including the Oncology Care Model, provide access to cancer care planning for Medicare beneficiaries who receive their cancer care in practices that are part of the Oncology Care Model. Other Medicare beneficiaries who are not enrolled in these delivery demonstrations may not have access to a cancer care plan or appropriate care coordination. (15) The failure to provide a cancer care plan to patients in many care settings relates in part to inadequate Medicare payment for such planning and coordination services. (16) Changes in Medicare payment for cancer care planning and coordination will support shared decisionmaking that reviews all treatment options and will contribute to improved care for individuals with cancer from the time of diagnosis through the end of the life. Medicare payment for cancer care planning may begin a reform process that helps us realize the well-planned and well-coordinated cancer care that has been recommended by the Institute of Medicine/National Academy of Medicine and that is preferred by cancer patients across the Nation.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the \u201cClean and Efficient Cars Act of 2018\u201d. SEC. 2. Findings; sense of Congress. (a) Findings.\u2014The Congress finds the following: (1) In 2009, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Department of Transportation\u2019s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reached an historic agreement with State regulators, automakers, the United Auto Workers, and leaders in the environmental community to establish One National Program for Federal standards to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increase corporate average fuel economy (CAF\u00c9) for light duty vehicles, in cooperation and alignment with the California Air Resources Board (CARB). (2) In 2012, as part of One National Program, EPA established final GHG emission standards for model years 2017 through 2025 and NHTSA established final CAF\u00c9 standards for model years 2017 through 2021 and augural standards for model years 2022 through 2025. (3) The agencies\u2019 standards are based on the specific footprint of vehicles to provide automotive manufacturers flexibility and ensure that consumers have a choice of a full range of vehicle sizes to meet their needs. Under the footprint-based system, small vehicles must meet more stringent standards than large vehicles. (4) A midterm evaluation of the standards for model years 2022 through 2025 concluded that they remain feasible for industry, with multiple pathways for compliance, and are appropriate for achieving the goals of cutting GHG emissions and increasing fuel economy. (5) In January 2017, EPA issued a final determination to maintain the existing GHG emissions standards for model years 2022 through 2025 as prescribed by the 2012 final rule. NHTSA is currently assessing the augural CAF\u00c9 standards proposed for model years 2022 through 2025 and will conduct a rulemaking to prescribe final standards for those years. (6) The final GHG emission standards and augural CAF\u00c9 standards for model years 2022 through 2025 are projected to achieve an average overall fleet-wide emissions target of 173 grams CO2 per mile and an average overall fleet-wide fuel economy target of 46.3 miles per gallon by the year 2025, resulting in a 540 million metric ton reduction in greenhouse gases and a 1.2 billion barrel reduction in oil consumption over the lifetime of these vehicles. (b) Sense of congress.\u2014It is the sense of Congress that maintaining the GHG and CAF\u00c9 standards at their current levels through model year 2025\u2014 (1) is essential to achieving the projected fleet wide average goals of 173 grams CO2 per mile and 46.3 miles per gallon; and (2) will result in substantial benefits for American drivers, the environment, public health, and energy security. SEC. 3. NHTSA average fuel economy standards for 2021 through 2025. Section 32902(b)(2) of title 49, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new subparagraphs: \u201c(D) AUTOMOBILE FUEL ECONOMY AVERAGE FOR MODEL YEARS 2021 THROUGH 2025.\u2014The Secretary shall, not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this subparagraph, prescribe by regulation and maintain fuel economy standards for model years 2021 through 2025 that are at least as stringent as the final standards for 2021 and the augural standards for 2022 through 2025 set out in the 2012 joint EPA/DOT Final Rule on 2017 and Later Model Year Light-Duty Vehicle Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards. \u201c(E) RESTRICTION ON REVISING STANDARDS OR CREATING NEW LOOPHOLES.\u2014The Secretary may not take any action that could effectively reduce the stringency of the average fuel economy standards required to be attained by each fleet of passenger and non-passenger automobiles manufactured for sale in the United States for model years up to and including 2025, including by revising the trading, transferring, availability, or creation of credits.\u201d. SEC. 4. EPA greenhouse gas emission standards through 2025. (a) Affirming standards.\u2014Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall affirm, under section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7521(a)), the greenhouse gas emission standards for light-duty vehicles for model years 2017 through 2025 that were published in the Federal Register by the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on October 15, 2012, in the final rule entitled \u201c2017 and Later Model Year Light-Duty Vehicle Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards\u201d (77 Fed. Reg. 62623), including such standards for model years 2022 through 2025 that were found by the Environmental Protection Agency to remain appropriate in the \u201cFinal Determination on the Appropriateness of the Model Year 2022\u20132025 Light-Duty Vehicle Greenhouse Gas Emissions Standards under the Midterm Evaluation\u201d issued in January 2017. (b) Restriction on Revising Standards or Creating New Loopholes.\u2014The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency may not take any action that could effectively reduce the stringency of greenhouse gas emission standards required to be attained by each fleet of light-duty vehicles manufactured for sale in the United States for model years up to and including 2025, including by revising the trading, transferring, availability, or creation of credits.", "115th CONGRESS2d Session H.

Composite plan restrictions to preserve legacy plan funding. \u201c(a) Treatment as a legacy plan.\u2014 \u201c(1) IN GENERAL.\u2014For purposes of this part and parts 2 and 3, a defined benefit plan shall be treated as a legacy plan with respect to the composite plan under which the employees who were eligible to accrue a benefit under the defined benefit plan become eligible to accrue a benefit under such composite plan. \u201c(2) COMPONENT PLANS.\u2014In any case in which a defined benefit plan is amended to add a composite plan component pursuant to section 801(b), paragraph (1) shall be applied by substituting \u2018defined benefit component\u2019 for \u2018defined benefit plan\u2019 and \u2018composite plan component\u2019 for \u2018composite plan\u2019. \u201c(3) ELIGIBLE TO ACCRUE A BENEFIT.\u2014For purposes of paragraph (1), an employee is considered eligible to accrue a benefit under a composite plan as of the first day in which the employee completes an hour of service under a collective bargaining agreement that provides for contributions to and accruals under the composite plan in lieu of accruals under the legacy plan. \u201c(4) COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT.\u2014As used in this part, the term \u2018collective bargaining agreement\u2019 includes any agreement under which an employer has an obligation to contribute to a plan. \u201c(5) OTHER TERMS.\u2014Any term used in this part which is not defined in this part and which is also used in section 305 shall have the same meaning provided such term in such section. \u201c(b) Restrictions on acceptance by composite plan of agreements and contributions.\u2014 \u201c(1) IN GENERAL.\u2014The plan sponsor of a composite plan shall not accept or recognize a collective bargaining agreement (or any modification to such agreement), and no contributions may be accepted and no benefits may be accrued or otherwise earned under the agreement\u2014 \u201c(A) in any case in which the plan actuary of any defined benefit plan that would be treated as a legacy plan with respect to such composite plan has certified under section 305(b)(3) that such defined benefit plan is or will be in critical status for the plan year in which such agreement would take effect or for any of the succeeding 5 plan years; and \u201c(B) unless the agreement requires each employer who is a party to such agreement, including employers whose employees are not participants in the legacy plan, to provide contributions to the legacy plan with respect to such composite plan in a manner that satisfies the transition contribution requirements of subsection (d). \u201c(2) NOTICE.\u2014Not later than 30 days after a determination by a plan sponsor of a composite plan that an agreement fails to satisfy the requirements described in paragraph (1), the plan sponsor shall provide notification of such failure and the reasons for such determination\u2014 \u201c(A) to the parties to the agreement; \u201c(B) to active participants of the composite plan who have ceased to accrue or otherwise earn benefits with respect to service with an employer pursuant to paragraph (1); and \u201c(C) to the Secretary, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. \u201c(3) LIMITATION ON RETROACTIVE EFFECT.\u2014This subsection shall not apply to benefits accrued before the date on which notice is provided under paragraph (2). \u201c(c) Restriction on accrual of benefits under a composite plan.\u2014 \u201c(1) IN GENERAL.\u2014In any case in which an employer, under a collective bargaining agreement entered into after February 5, 2018, ceases to have an obligation to contribute to a multiemployer defined benefit plan, no employees employed by the employer may accrue or otherwise earn benefits under any composite plan, with respect to service with that employer, for a 60-month period beginning on the date on which the employer entered into such collective bargaining agreement. \u201c(2) NOTICE OF CESSATION OF OBLIGATION.\u2014Within 30 days of determining that an employer has ceased to have an obligation to contribute to a legacy plan with respect to employees employed by an employer that is or will be contributing to a composite plan with respect to service of such employees, the plan sponsor of the legacy plan shall notify the plan sponsor of the composite plan of that cessation. \u201c(3) NOTICE OF CESSATION OF ACCRUALS.\u2014Not later than 30 days after determining that an employer has ceased to have an obligation to contribute to a legacy plan, the plan sponsor of the composite plan shall notify the bargaining parties, the active participants affected by the cessation of accruals, the Secretary, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation of the cessation of accruals, the period during which such cessation is in effect, and the reasons therefor. \u201c(4) LIMITATION ON RETROACTIVE EFFECT.\u2014This subsection shall not apply to benefits accrued before the date on which notice is provided under paragraph (3). \u201c(d) Transition contribution requirements.\u2014 \u201c(1) IN GENERAL.\u2014A collective bargaining agreement satisfies the transition contribution requirements of this subsection if the agreement\u2014 \u201c(A) authorizes payment of contributions to a legacy plan at a rate or rates equal to or greater than the transition contribution rate established by the legacy plan under paragraph (2); and \u201c(B) does not provide for\u2014 \u201c(i) a suspension of contributions to the legacy plan with respect to any period of service; or \u201c(ii) any new direct or indirect exclusion of younger or newly hired employees of the employer from being taken into account in determining contributions owed to the legacy plan. \u201c(2) TRANSITION CONTRIBUTION RATE.\u2014 \u201c(A) IN GENERAL.\u2014The transition contribution rate for a plan year is the contribution rate that, as certified by the actuary of the legacy plan in accordance with the principles in section 305(b)(3)(B), is reasonably expected to be adequate\u2014 \u201c(i) to fund the normal cost for the plan year; \u201c(ii) to amortize the plan\u2019s unfunded liabilities in level annual installments over 25 years, beginning with the plan year in which the transition contribution rate is first established; and \u201c(iii) to amortize any subsequent changes in the legacy plan\u2019s unfunded liability due to experience gains or losses (including investment gains or losses, gains or losses due to contributions greater or less than the contributions made under the prior transition contribution rate, and other actuarial gains or losses), changes in actuarial assumptions, changes to the legacy plan\u2019s benefits, or changes in funding method over a period of 15 plan years beginning with the plan year in which such change in unfunded liability is incurred.The transition contribution rate for any plan year may not be less than the transition contribution rate for the plan year in which such rate is first established. \u201c(B) MULTIPLE RATES.\u2014If different rates of contribution are payable to the legacy plan by different employers or for different classes of employees, the certification shall specify a transition contribution rate for each such employer. \u201c(C) RATE APPLICABLE TO EMPLOYER.\u2014 \u201c(i) IN GENERAL.\u2014Except as provided by clause (ii), the transition contribution rate applicable to an employer for a plan year is the rate in effect for the plan year of the legacy plan that commences on or after 180 days before the earlier of\u2014 \u201c(I) the effective date of the collective bargaining agreement pursuant to which the employer contributes to the legacy plan; or \u201c(II) 5 years after the last plan year for which the transition contribution rate applicable to the employer was established or updated. \u201c(ii) EXCEPTION.\u2014The transition contribution rate applicable to an employer for the first plan year beginning on or after the commencement of the employer\u2019s obligation to contribute to the composite plan is the rate in effect for the plan year of the legacy plan that commences on or after 180 days before such first plan year. \u201c(D) EFFECT OF LEGACY PLAN FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES.\u2014If the plan actuary of the legacy plan has certified under section 305 that the plan is in endangered or critical status for a plan year, the transition contribution rate for the following plan year is the rate determined with respect to the employer under the legacy plan\u2019s funding improvement or rehabilitation plan under section 305, if greater than the rate otherwise determined, but in no event greater than 75 percent of the sum of the contribution rates applicable to the legacy plan and the composite plan for the plan year. \u201c(E) OTHER ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS.\u2014Except as provided in subparagraph (A), the determination of the transition contribution rate for a plan year shall be based on actuarial assumptions and methods consistent with the minimum funding determinations made under section 304 (or, if applicable, section 305) with respect to the legacy plan for the plan year. \u201c(F) ADJUSTMENTS IN RATE.\u2014The plan sponsor of a legacy plan from time to time may adjust the transition contribution rate or rates applicable to an employer under this paragraph by increasing some rates and decreasing others if the actuary certifies that such adjusted rates in combination will produce projected contribution income for the plan year beginning on or after the date of certification that is not less than would be produced by the transition contribution rates in effect at the time of the certification. \u201c(G) NOTICE OF TRANSITION CONTRIBUTION RATE.\u2014The plan sponsor of a legacy plan shall provide notice to the parties to collective bargaining agreements pursuant to which contributions are made to the legacy plan of changes to the transition contribution rate requirements at least 30 days before the beginning of the plan year for which the rate is effective. \u201c(H) NOTICE TO COMPOSITE PLAN SPONSOR.\u2014Not later than 30 days after a determination by the plan sponsor of a legacy plan that a collective bargaining agreement provides for a rate of contributions that is below the transition contribution rate applicable to one or more employers that are parties to the collective bargaining agreement, the plan sponsor of the legacy plan shall notify the plan sponsor of any composite plan under which employees of such employer would otherwise be eligible to accrue a benefit. \u201c(3) CORRECTION PROCEDURES.\u2014Pursuant to standards prescribed by the Secretary, the plan sponsor of a composite plan shall adopt rules and procedures that give the parties to the collective bargaining agreement notice of the failure of such agreement to satisfy the transition contribution requirements of this subsection, and a reasonable opportunity to correct such failure, not to exceed 180 days from the date of notice given under subsection (b)(2). \u201c(4) SUPPLEMENTAL CONTRIBUTIONS.\u2014A collective bargaining agreement may provide for supplemental contributions to the legacy plan for a plan year in excess of the transition contribution rate determined under paragraph (2), regardless of whether the legacy plan is in endangered or critical status for such plan year. \u201c(e) Nonapplication of composite plan restrictions.\u2014 \u201c(1) IN GENERAL.\u2014The provisions of subsections (a), (b), and (c) shall not apply with respect to a collective bargaining agreement, to the extent the agreement, or a predecessor agreement, provides or provided for contributions to a defined benefit plan that is a legacy plan, as of the first day of the first plan year following a plan year for which the plan actuary certifies that the plan is fully funded, has been fully funded for at least three out of the immediately preceding 5 plan years, and is projected to remain fully funded for at least the following 4 plan years. \u201c(2) DETERMINATION OF FULLY FUNDED.\u2014A plan is fully funded for purposes of paragraph (1) if, as of the valuation date of the plan for a plan year, the value of the plan\u2019s assets equals or exceeds the present value of the plan\u2019s liabilities, determined in accordance with the rules prescribed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation under sections 4219(c)(1)(D) and 4281 for multiemployer plans terminating by mass withdrawal, as in effect for the date of the determination, except the plan\u2019s reasonable assumption regarding the starting date of benefits may be used. \u201c(3) OTHER APPLICABLE RULES.\u2014Except as provided in paragraph (2), actuarial determinations and projections under this section shall be based on the rules in section 305(b)(3) and section 802(b). \u201cSEC. 806. Mergers and asset transfers of composite plans. \u201c(a) In general.\u2014Assets and liabilities of a composite plan may only be merged with, or transferred to, another plan if\u2014 \u201c(1) the other plan is a composite plan; \u201c(2) the plan or plans resulting from the merger or transfer is a composite plan; \u201c(3) no participant\u2019s accrued benefit or adjustable benefit is lower immediately after the transaction than it was immediately before the transaction; and \u201c(4) the value of the assets transferred in the case of a transfer reasonably reflects the value of the amounts contributed with respect to the participants whose benefits are being transferred, adjusted for allocable distributions, investment gains and losses, and administrative expenses. \u201c(b) Legacy plan.\u2014 \u201c(1) IN GENERAL.\u2014After a merger or transfer involving a composite plan, the legacy plan with respect to an employer that is obligated to contribute to the resulting composite plan is the legacy plan that applied to that employer immediately before the merger or transfer. \u201c(2) MULTIPLE LEGACY PLANS.\u2014If an employer is obligated to contribute to more than one legacy plan with respect to employees eligible to accrue benefits under more than one composite plan and there is a merger or transfer of such legacy plans, the transition contribution rate applicable to the legacy plan resulting from the merger or transfer with respect to that employer shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of section 805(d)(2)(B).\u201d.

Composite plan defined. \u201c(a) In general.\u2014For purposes of this title, the term \u2018composite plan\u2019 means a pension plan\u2014 \u201c(1) which is a multiemployer plan that is neither a defined benefit plan nor a defined contribution plan, \u201c(2) the terms of which provide that the plan is a composite plan for purposes of this title with respect to which not more than one multiemployer defined benefit plan is treated as a legacy plan within the meaning of section 440A, unless there is more than one legacy plan following a merger of composite plans under section 440B, \u201c(3) which provides systematically for the payment of benefits\u2014 \u201c(A) objectively calculated pursuant to a formula enumerated in the plan document with respect to plan participants after retirement, for life, and \u201c(B) in the form of life annuities, except for benefits which under section 411(a)(11) may be immediately distributed without the consent of the participant, \u201c(4) for which the plan contributions for the first plan year are at least 120 percent of the normal cost for the plan year, \u201c(5) which requires\u2014 \u201c(A) an annual valuation of the liability of

reduction under a realignment program pursuant to section 439 based on the plan\u2019s funded status in future plan years, and \u201c(6) the board of trustees of which includes at least one retiree or beneficiary in pay status during each plan year following the first plan year in which at least 5 percent of the participants in the plan are retirees or beneficiaries in pay status. \u201c(b) Transition from a multiemployer defined benefit plan.\u2014 \u201c(1) IN GENERAL.\u2014The plan sponsor of a defined benefit plan that is a multiemployer plan may, subject to paragraph (2), amend the plan to incorporate the features of a composite plan as a component of the multiemployer plan separate from the defined benefit plan component, except in the case of a defined benefit plan for which the plan actuary has certified under section 432(b)(3) that the plan is or will be in critical status for the plan year in which such amendment would become effective or for any of the succeeding 5 plan years. \u201c(2) REQUIREMENTS.\u2014Any amendment pursuant to paragraph (1) to incorporate the features of a composite plan as a component of a multiemployer plan shall\u2014 \u201c(A) apply with respect to all collective bargaining agreements providing for contributions to the multiemployer plan on or after the effective date of the amendment, \u201c(B) apply with respect to all participants in the multiemployer plan for whom contributions are made to the multiemployer plan on or after the effective date of the amendment, \u201c(C) specify that the effective date of the amendment is\u2014 \u201c(i) the first day of a specified plan year following the date of the adoption of the amendment, except that the plan sponsor may alternatively provide for a separate effective date with respect to each collective bargaining agreement under which contributions to the multiemployer plan are required, which shall occur on the first day of the first plan year beginning after the termination, or if earlier, the re-opening, of each such agreement, or such earlier date as the parties to the agreement and the plan sponsor of the multiemployer plan shall agree to, and \u201c(ii) not later than the first day of the fifth plan year beginning on or after the date of the adoption of the amendment, \u201c(D) specify that, as of the amendment\u2019s effective date, no further benefits shall accrue under the defined benefit component of the multiemployer plan, and \u201c(E) specify that, as of the amendment\u2019s effective date, the plan sponsor of the multiemployer plan shall be the plan sponsor of both the composite plan component and the defined benefit plan component of the plan. \u201c(3) SPECIAL RULES.\u2014If a multiemployer plan is amended pursuant to paragraph (1)\u2014 \u201c(A) the requirements of this title shall be applied to the composite plan component and the defined benefit plan component of the multiemployer plan as if each such component were maintained as a separate plan, and \u201c(B) the assets of the composite plan component and the defined benefit plan component of the plan shall be held in a single trust forming part of the plan under which the trust instrument expressly provides\u2014 \u201c(i) for separate accounts (and appropriate records) to be maintained to reflect the interest which each of the plan components has in the trust, including separate accounting for additions to the trust for the benefit of each plan component, disbursements made from each plan component\u2019s account in the trust, investment experience of the

other plan component. \u201c(4) NOT A TERMINATION EVENT.\u2014Notwithstanding section 4041A of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, an amendment pursuant to paragraph (1) to incorporate the features of a composite plan as a component of a multiemployer plan does not constitute termination of the multiemployer plan. \u201c(5) NOTICE TO THE SECRETARY.\u2014 \u201c(A) NOTICE.\u2014The plan sponsor of a composite plan shall provide notice to the Secretary of the intent to establish the composite plan (or, in the case of a composite plan incorporated as a component of a multiemployer plan as described in paragraph (1), the intent to amend the multiemployer plan to incorporate such composite plan) at least 30 days prior to the effective date of such establishment or amendment. \u201c(B) CERTIFICATION.\u2014In the case of a composite plan incorporated as a component of a multiemployer plan as described in paragraph (1), such notice shall include a certification by the plan actuary under section 432(b)(3) that the effective date of the amendment occurs in a plan year for which the multiemployer plan is not in critical status for that plan year and any of the succeeding 5 plan years. \u201c(6) REFERENCES TO COMPOSITE PLAN COMPONENT.\u2014As used in this subpart, the term \u2018composite plan\u2019 includes a composite plan component added to a defined benefit plan pursuant to paragraph (1). \u201c(7) RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.\u2014Paragraph (2)(A) shall not be construed as preventing the plan sponsor of a multiemployer plan from adopting an amendment pursuant to paragraph (1) because some collective bargaining agreements are amended to cease any covered employer's obligation to contribute to the multiemployer plan before or after the plan amendment is effective. Paragraph (2)(B) shall not be construed as preventing the plan sponsor of a multiemployer plan from adopting an amendment pursuant to paragraph (1) because some participants cease to have contributions made to the multiemployer plan on their behalf before or after the plan amendment is effective. \u201c(c) Coordination with funding rules.\u2014Except as otherwise provided in this title, sections 412, 431, and 432 shall not apply to a composite plan. \u201c(d) Treatment of a composite plan.\u2014For purposes of this title (other than sections 412 and 418E), a composite plan shall be treated as if it were a defined benefit plan unless a different treatment is provided for under applicable law. \u201cSEC. 438. Funded ratios; actuarial assumptions. \u201c(a) Certification of funded ratios.\u2014 \u201c(1) IN GENERAL.\u2014Not later than the one-hundred twentieth day of each plan year of a composite plan, the plan actuary of the composite plan shall certify to the Secretary, the Secretary of Labor, and the plan sponsor the plan\u2019s current funded ratio and projected funded ratio for the plan year. \u201c(2) DETERMINATION OF CURRENT FUNDED RATIO AND PROJECTED FUNDED RATIO.\u2014For purposes of this section\u2014 \u201c(A) CURRENT FUNDED RATIO.\u2014The current funded ratio is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of\u2014 \u201c(i) the value of the plan\u2019s assets as of the first day of the plan year, to \u201c(ii) the plan actuary\u2019s best estimate of the present value of the plan liabilities as of the first day of the plan year. \u201c(B) PROJECTED FUNDED RATIO.\u2014The projected funded ratio is the current funded ratio projected to the first day of the fifteenth plan year following the plan year for which the determination is being made. \u201c(3) CONSIDERATION OF CONTRIBUTION RATE INCREASES.\u2014For purposes of projections under this subsection, the plan sponsor may anticipate contribution rate increases beyond the term of the current collective bargaining agreement and any agreed-to supplements, up to a maximum of 2.5 percent per year, compounded annually, unless it would be unreasonable under the circumstances to assume that contributions would increase by that amount. \u201c(b) Actuarial assumptions and methods.\u2014For purposes of this part\u2014 \u201c(1) IN GENERAL.\u2014All costs, liabilities, rates of interest, and other factors under the plan shall be determined for a plan year on the basis of actuarial assumptions and methods\u2014 \u201c(A) each of which is reasonable (taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations), \u201c(B) which, in combination, offer the actuary\u2019s best estimate of anticipated experience under the plan, and \u201c(C) with respect to which any change from the actuarial assumptions and methods used in the previous plan year shall be certified by the plan actuary and the actuarial rationale for such change provided in the annual report required by section 6058. \u201c(2) FAIR MARKET VALUE OF ASSETS.\u2014The value of the plan\u2019s assets shall be taken into account on the basis of their fair market value. \u201c(3) DETERMINATION OF NORMAL COST AND PLAN LIABILITIES.\u2014A plan\u2019s normal cost and liabilities shall be based on the most recent actuarial valuation required under section 437(a)(5)(A) and the unit credit funding method. \u201c(4) TIME WHEN CERTAIN CONTRIBUTIONS DEEMED MADE.\u2014Any contributions for a plan year made by an employer after the last day of such plan year, but not later than two and one-half months after such day, shall be deemed to have been made on such last day. For purposes of this paragraph, such two and one-half month period may be extended for not more than six months under regulations prescribed by the Secretary. \u201c(5) ADDITIONAL ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS.\u2014Except where otherwise provided in this subpart, the provisions of section 432(b)(3)(B) shall apply to any determination or projection under this subpart. \u201cSEC. 439. Realignment program. \u201c(a) Realignment program.\u2014 \u201c(1) ADOPTION.\u2014In any case in which the plan actuary certifies under section 438(a) that the plan\u2019s projected funded ratio is below 120 percent for the plan year, the plan sponsor shall adopt a realignment program under paragraph (2) not later than 210 days after the due date of the certification required under section 438(a). The plan sponsor shall adopt an updated realignment program for each succeeding plan year for which a certification described in the preceding sentence is made. \u201c(2) CONTENT OF REALIGNMENT PROGRAM.\u2014 \u201c(A) IN GENERAL.\u2014A realignment program adopted under this paragraph is a written program which consists of all reasonable measures, including options or a range of options to be undertaken by the plan sponsor or proposed to the bargaining parties, formulated, based on reasonably anticipated experience and reasonable actuarial assumptions, to enable the plan to achieve a projected funded ratio of at least 120 percent for the following plan year. \u201c(B) INITIAL PROGRAM ELEMENTS.\u2014Reasonable measures under a realignment program described in subparagraph (A) may include any of the following: \u201c(i) Proposed contribution increases. \u201c(ii) A reduction in the rate of future benefit accruals, so long as the resulting rate shall not be less than 1 percent of the contributions on which benefits are based as of the start of the plan year (or the equivalent standard accrual rate as described in section 432(e)(6)). \u201c(iii) A modification or elimination of adjustable benefits of participants that are not in pay status before the date of the notice required under subsection (b)(1). \u201c(iv) Any other legally available measures not specifically described in this subparagraph or subparagraph (C) or (D) that the plan sponsor determines are reasonable. \u201c(C) ADDITIONAL PROGRAM ELEMENTS.\u2014If the plan sponsor has determined that all reasonable measures available under subparagraph (B) will not enable the plan to achieve a projected funded ratio of at least 120 percent the following plan year, such reasonable measures may also include\u2014 \u201c(i) a reduction of accrued benefits that are not in pay status by the date of the notice required under subsection (b)(1), or \u201c(ii) a reduction of any benefits of participants that are in pay status before the date of the notice required under subsection (b)(1) other than core benefits as defined in paragraph (4). \u201c(D) ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS.\u2014In the case of a composite plan for which the plan sponsor has determined that all reasonable measures available under subparagraphs (B) and (C) will not enable the plan to achieve a projected funded ratio of at least 120 percent for the following plan year, such reasonable measures may also include\u2014 \u201c(i) a further reduction in the rate of future benefit accruals without regard to the limitation applicable under subparagraph (B)(ii), or \u201c(ii) a reduction of core benefits,provided that such reductions shall be equitably distributed across the participant and beneficiary population, taking into account factors, with respect to participants and beneficiaries and their benefits, that may include one or more of the factors listed in subclauses (I) through (X) of section 432(e)(9)(D)(vi), to the extent necessary to enable the plan to achieve a projected funded ratio of at least 120 percent for the following plan year, or at the election of the plan sponsor, a projected funded ratio of at least 100 percent for the following plan year and a current funded ratio of at least 90 percent. \u201c(3) ADJUSTABLE BENEFIT DEFINED.\u2014For purposes of this subpart, the term \u2018adjustable benefit\u2019 means\u2014 \u201c(A) benefits, rights, and features under the plan, including post-retirement death benefits, 60-month guarantees, disability benefits not yet in pay status, and similar benefits, \u201c(B) any early retirement benefit or retirement-type subsidy (within the meaning of section 411(d)(6)(B)(i)) and any benefit payment option (other than the qualified joint and survivor annuity), and \u201c(C) benefit increases that were adopted (or, if later, took effect) less than 60 months before the first day such realignment program took effect. \u201c(4) CORE BENEFIT DEFINED.\u2014For purposes of this subpart, the term \u2018core benefit\u2019 means a participant\u2019s accrued benefit payable in the normal form of an annuity commencing at normal retirement age, determined without regard to\u2014 \u201c(A) any early retirement benefits, retirement-type subsidies, or other benefits, rights, or features that may be associated with that benefit, and \u201c(B) any cost-of-living adjustments or benefit increases effective after the date of retirement. \u201c(5) COORDINATION WITH CONTRIBUTION INCREASES.\u2014 \u201c(A) IN GENERAL.\u2014A realignment program may provide that some or all of the benefit modifications described in the program will only take effect if the bargaining parties fail to agree to specified levels of increases in contributions to the plan, effective as of specified dates. \u201c(B) INDEPENDENT BENEFIT MODIFICATIONS.\u2014If a realignment program adopts any changes to the benefit formula that are independent of potential contribution increases, such changes shall take effect not later than 180 days following the first day of the first plan year that begins following the adoption of the realignment program. \u201c(C) CONDITIONAL BENEFIT MODIFICATIONS.\u2014If a realignment program adopts any changes to the benefit formula that take effect only if the bargaining parties fail to agree to contribution increases, such changes shall take effect not later than the first day of the first plan year beginning after the third anniversary of the date of adoption of the realignment program. \u201c(D) REVOCATION OF CERTAIN BENEFIT MODIFICATIONS.\u2014Benefit modifications described in paragraph (3) may be revoked, in whole or in part, and retroactively or prospectively, when contributions to the plan are increased, as specified in the realignment program, including any amendments thereto. The preceding sentence shall not apply unless the contribution increases are to be effective not later than the fifth anniversary of the first day of the first plan year that begins after the adoption of the realignment program. \u201c(b) Notice.\u2014 \u201c(1) IN GENERAL.\u2014In any case in which it is certified under section 438(a) that the projected funded ratio is less than 120 percent, the plan sponsor shall, not later than 30 days after the date of the certification, provide notification of the current and projected funded ratios to the participants and beneficiaries, the bargaining parties, and the Secretary. Such notice shall include\u2014 \u201c(A) an explanation that contribution rate increases or benefit reductions may be necessary, \u201c(B) a description of the types of benefits that might be reduced, and \u201c(C) an estimate of the contribution increases and benefit reductions that may be necessary to achieve a projected funded ratio of 120 percent. \u201c(2) NOTICE OF BENEFIT MODIFICATIONS.\u2014 \u201c(A) IN GENERAL.\u2014No modifications may be made that reduce the rate of future benefit accrual or that reduce core benefits or adjustable benefits unless notice of such reduction has been given at least 180 days before the general effective date of such reduction for all participants and beneficiaries to\u2014 \u201c(i) plan participants and beneficiaries, \u201c(ii) each employer who has an obligation to contribute to the composite plan, and \u201c(iii) each employee organization which, for purposes of collective bargaining, represents plan participants employed by such employers. \u201c(B) CONTENT OF NOTICE.\u2014The notice under subparagraph (A) shall contain\u2014 \u201c(i) sufficient information to enable participants and beneficiaries to understand the effect of any reduction on their benefits, including an illustration of any affected benefit or subsidy, on an annual or monthly basis that a participant or beneficiary would otherwise have been eligible for as of the general effective date described in subparagraph (A), and \u201c(ii) information as to the rights and remedies of plan participants and beneficiaries as well as how to contact the Department of Labor for further information and assistance, where appropriate. \u201c(C) FORM AND MANNER.\u2014Any notice under subparagraph (A)\u2014 \u201c(i) shall be provided in a form and manner prescribed in regulations of the Secretary of Labor, \u201c(ii) shall be written in a manner so as to be understood by the average plan participant. \u201c(3) MODEL NOTICES.\u2014The Secretary shall\u2014 \u201c(A) prescribe model notices that the plan sponsor of a composite plan may use to satisfy the notice requirements under this subsection, and \u201c(B) by regulation enumerate any details related to the elements listed in paragraph (1) that any notice under this subsection must include. \u201c(4) DELIVERY METHOD.\u2014Any notice under this part shall be provided in writing and may also be provided in electronic form to the extent that the form is reasonably accessible to persons to whom the notice is provided. \u201cSEC. 440. Limitation on increasing benefits. \u201c(a) Level of current funded ratios.\u2014Except as provided in subsections (c), (d), and (e), no plan amendment increasing benefits or establishing new benefits under a composite plan may be adopted for a plan year unless\u2014 \u201c(1) the plan\u2019s current funded ratio is at least 110 percent (without regard to the benefit increase or new benefits), \u201c(2) taking the benefit increase or new benefits into account, the current funded ratio is at least 100 percent and the projected funded ratio for the current plan year is at least 120 percent, \u201c(3) in any case in which, after taking the benefit increase or new benefits into account, the current funded ratio is less than 140 percent or the projected funded ratio is less than 140 percent, the benefit increase or new benefits are projected by the plan actuary to increase the present value of the plan\u2019s liabilities for the plan year by not more than 3 percent, and \u201c(4) expected contributions for the current plan year are at least 120 percent of normal cost for the plan year, determined using the unit credit funding method and treating the benefit increase or new benefits as in effect for the entire plan year. \u201c(b) Additional requirements where core benefits reduced.\u2014If a plan has been amended to reduce core benefits pursuant to a realignment program under section 439(a)(2)(D), such plan may not be subsequently amended to increase core benefits unless the amendment\u2014 \u201c(1) increases the level of future benefit payments only, and \u201c(2) provides for an equitable distribution of benefit increases across the participant and beneficiary population, taking into account the extent to which the benefits of participants were previously reduced pursuant to such realignment program. \u201c(c) Exception To comply with applicable law.\u2014Subsection (a) shall not apply in connection with a plan amendment if the amendment is required as a condition of qualification under part I of subchapter D of chapter 1 or to comply with other applicable law. \u201c(d) Exception where maximum deductible limit applies.\u2014Subsection (a) shall not apply in connection with a plan amendment if and to the extent that contributions to the composite plan would not be deductible for the plan year under section 404(a)(1)(E) if the plan amendment is not adopted.

Composite plan restrictions to preserve legacy plan funding. \u201c(a) Treatment as a legacy plan.\u2014 \u201c(1) IN GENERAL.\u2014For purposes of this subchapter, a defined benefit plan shall be treated as a legacy plan with respect to the composite plan under which the employees who were eligible to accrue a benefit under the defined benefit plan become eligible to accrue a benefit under such composite plan. \u201c(2) COMPONENT PLANS.\u2014In any case in which a defined benefit plan is amended to add a composite plan component pursuant to section 437(b), paragraph (1) shall be applied by substituting \u2018defined benefit component\u2019 for \u2018defined benefit plan\u2019 and \u2018composite plan component\u2019 for \u2018composite plan\u2019. \u201c(3) ELIGIBLE TO ACCRUE A BENEFIT.\u2014For purposes of paragraph (1), an employee is considered eligible to accrue a benefit under a composite plan as of the first day in which the employee completes an hour of service under a collective bargaining agreement that provides for contributions to and accruals under the composite plan in lieu of accruals under the legacy plan. \u201c(4) COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT.\u2014As used in this subpart, the term \u2018collective bargaining agreement\u2019 includes any agreement under which an employer has an obligation to contribute to a plan. \u201c(5) OTHER TERMS.\u2014Any term used in this subpart which is not defined in this part and which is also used in section 432 shall have the same meaning provided such term in such section. \u201c(b) Restrictions on acceptance by composite plan of agreements and contributions.\u2014 \u201c(1) IN GENERAL.\u2014The plan sponsor of a composite plan shall not accept or recognize a collective bargaining agreement (or any modification to such agreement), and no contributions may be accepted and no benefits may be accrued or otherwise earned under the agreement\u2014 \u201c(A) in any case in which the plan actuary of any defined benefit plan that would be treated as a legacy plan with respect to such composite plan has certified under section 432(b)(3) that such defined benefit plan is or will be in critical status for the plan year in which such agreement would take effect or for any of the succeeding 5 plan years, and \u201c(B) unless the agreement requires each employer who is a party to such agreement, including employers whose employees are not participants in the legacy plan, to provide contributions to the legacy plan with respect to such composite plan in a manner that satisfies the transition contribution requirements of subsection (d). \u201c(2) NOTICE.\u2014Not later than 30 days after a determination by a plan sponsor of a composite plan that an agreement fails to satisfy the requirements described in paragraph (1), the plan sponsor shall provide notification of such failure and the reasons for such determination to\u2014 \u201c(A) the parties to the agreement, \u201c(B) active participants of the composite plan who have ceased to accrue or otherwise earn benefits with respect to service with an employer pursuant to paragraph (1), and \u201c(C) the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. \u201c(3) LIMITATION ON RETROACTIVE EFFECT.\u2014This subsection shall not apply to benefits accrued before the date on which notice is provided under paragraph (2). \u201c(c) Restriction on accrual of benefits under a composite plan.\u2014 \u201c(1) IN GENERAL.\u2014In any case in which an employer, under a collective bargaining agreement entered into after February 5, 2018, ceases to have an obligation to contribute to a multiemployer defined benefit plan, no employees employed by the employer may accrue or otherwise earn benefits under any composite plan, with respect to service with that employer, for a 60-month period beginning on the date on which the employer entered into such collective bargaining agreement. \u201c(2) NOTICE OF CESSATION OF OBLIGATION.\u2014Within 30 days of determining that an employer has ceased to have an obligation to contribute to a legacy plan with respect to employees employed by an employer that is or will be contributing to a composite plan with respect to service of such employees, the plan sponsor of the legacy plan shall notify the plan sponsor of the composite plan of that cessation. \u201c(3) NOTICE OF CESSATION OF ACCRUALS.\u2014Not later than 30 days after determining that an employer has ceased to have an obligation to contribute to a legacy plan, the plan sponsor of the composite plan shall notify the bargaining parties, the active participants affected by the cessation of accruals, the Secretary, the Secretary of Labor, and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation of the cessation of accruals, the period during which such cessation is in effect, and the reasons therefor. \u201c(4) LIMITATION ON RETROACTIVE EFFECT.\u2014This subsection shall not apply to benefits accrued before the date on which notice is provided under paragraph (3). \u201c(d) Transition contribution requirements.\u2014 \u201c(1) IN GENERAL.\u2014A collective bargaining agreement satisfies the transition contribution requirements of this subsection if the agreement\u2014 \u201c(A) authorizes for payment of contributions to a legacy plan at a rate or rates equal to or greater than the transition contribution rate established under paragraph (2), and \u201c(B) does not provide for\u2014 \u201c(i) a suspension of contributions to the legacy plan with respect to any period of service, or \u201c(ii) any new direct or indirect exclusion of younger or newly hired employees of the employer from being taken into account in determining contributions owed to the legacy plan. \u201c(2) TRANSITION CONTRIBUTION RATE.\u2014 \u201c(A) IN GENERAL.\u2014The transition contribution rate for a plan year is the contribution rate that, as certified by the actuary of the legacy plan in accordance with the principles in section 432(b)(3)(B), is reasonably expected to be adequate\u2014 \u201c(i) to fund the normal cost for the plan year, \u201c(ii) to amortize the plan\u2019s unfunded liabilities in level annual installments over 25 years, beginning with the plan year in which the transition contribution rate is first established, and \u201c(iii) to amortize any subsequent changes in the legacy plan\u2019s unfunded liability due to experience gains or losses (including investment gains or losses, gains or losses due to contributions greater or less than the contributions made under the prior transition contribution rate, and other actuarial gains or losses), changes in actuarial assumptions, changes to the legacy plan\u2019s benefits, or changes in funding method over a period of 15 plan years beginning with the plan year in which such change in unfunded liability is incurred.The transition contribution rate for any plan year may not be less than the transition contribution rate for the plan year in which such rate is first established. \u201c(B) MULTIPLE RATES.\u2014If different rates of contribution are payable to the legacy plan by different employers or for different classes of employees, the certification shall specify a transition contribution rate for each such employer. \u201c(C) RATE APPLICABLE TO EMPLOYER.\u2014 \u201c(i) IN GENERAL.\u2014Except as provided by clause (ii), the transition contribution rate applicable to an employer for a plan year is the rate in effect for the plan year of the legacy plan that commences on or after 180 days before the earlier of\u2014 \u201c(I) the effective date of the collective bargaining agreement pursuant to which the employer contributes to the legacy plan, or \u201c(II) 5 years after the last plan year for which the transition contribution rate applicable to the employer was established or updated. \u201c(ii) EXCEPTION.\u2014The transition contribution rate applicable to an employer for the first plan year beginning on or after the commencement of the employer\u2019s obligation to contribute to the composite plan is the rate in effect for the plan year of the legacy plan that commences on or after 180 days before such first plan year. \u201c(D) EFFECT OF LEGACY PLAN FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES.\u2014If the plan actuary of the legacy plan has certified under section 432 that the plan is in endangered or critical status for a plan year, the transition contribution rate for the following plan year is the rate determined with respect to the employer under the legacy plan\u2019s funding improvement or rehabilitation plan under section 432, if greater than the rate otherwise determined, but in no event greater than 75 percent of the sum of the contribution rates applicable to the legacy plan and the composite plan for the plan year. \u201c(E) OTHER ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODS.\u2014Except as provided in subparagraph (A), the determination of the transition contribution rate for a plan year shall be based on actuarial assumptions and methods consistent with the minimum funding determinations made under section 431 (or, if applicable, section 432) with respect to the legacy plan for the plan year. \u201c(F) ADJUSTMENTS IN RATE.\u2014The plan sponsor of a legacy plan from time to time may adjust the transition contribution rate or rates applicable to an employer under this paragraph by increasing some rates and decreasing others if the actuary certifies that such adjusted rates in combination will produce projected contribution income for the plan year beginning on or after the date of certification that is not less than would be produced by the transition contribution rates in effect at the time of the certification. \u201c(G) NOTICE OF TRANSITION CONTRIBUTION RATE.\u2014The plan sponsor of a legacy plan shall provide notice to the parties to collective bargaining agreements pursuant to which contributions are made to the legacy plan of changes to the transition contribution rate requirements at least 30 days before the beginning of the plan year for which the rate is effective. \u201c(H) NOTICE TO COMPOSITE PLAN SPONSOR.\u2014Not later than 30 days after a determination by the plan sponsor of a legacy plan that a collective bargaining agreement provides for a rate of contributions that is below the transition contribution rate applicable to one or more employers that are parties to the collective bargaining agreement, the plan sponsor of the legacy plan shall notify the plan sponsor of any composite plan under which employees of such employer would otherwise be eligible to accrue a benefit. \u201c(3) CORRECTION PROCEDURES.\u2014Pursuant to standards prescribed by the Secretary of Labor, the plan sponsor of a composite plan shall adopt rules and procedures that give the parties to the collective bargaining agreement notice of the failure of such agreement to satisfy the transition contribution requirements of this subsection, and a reasonable opportunity to correct such failure, not to exceed 180 days from the date of notice given under subsection (b)(2). \u201c(4) SUPPLEMENTAL CONTRIBUTIONS.\u2014A collective bargaining agreement may provide for supplemental contributions to the legacy plan for a plan year in excess of the transition contribution rate determined under paragraph (2), regardless of whether the legacy plan is in endangered or critical status for such plan year. \u201c(e) Nonapplication of composite plan restrictions.\u2014 \u201c(1) IN GENERAL.\u2014The provisions of subsections (a), (b), and (c) shall not apply with respect to a collective bargaining agreement, to the extent the agreement, or a predecessor agreement, provides or provided for contributions to a defined benefit plan that is a legacy plan, as of the first day of the first plan year following a plan year for which the plan actuary certifies that the plan is fully funded, has been fully funded for at least three out of the immediately preceding 5 plan years, and is projected to remain fully funded for at least the following 4 plan years. \u201c(2) DETERMINATION OF FULLY FUNDED.\u2014A plan is fully funded for purposes of paragraph (1) if, as of the valuation date of the plan for a plan year, the value of the plan\u2019s assets equals or exceeds the present value of the plan\u2019s liabilities, determined in accordance with the rules prescribed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation under sections 4219(c)(1)(D) and 4281 of Employee Retirement Income and Security Act for multiemployer plans terminating by mass withdrawal, as in effect for the date of the

R. 4846 To provide collective bargaining rights for public safety officers employed by States or their political subdivisions. IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES January 19, 2018 Mr. Kildee (for himself and Mr. Duncan of Tennessee) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Education and the Workforce A BILL To provide collective bargaining rights for public safety officers employed by States or their political subdivisions. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the \u201cPublic Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act\u201d. SEC. 2. Purpose and policy. Congress declares that the following is the policy of the United States: (1) Labor-management relationships and partnerships are based on trust, mutual respect, open communication, bilateral consensual problem solving, and shared accountability. Labor-management cooperation fully utilizes the strengths of both parties to best serve the interests of the public, operating as a team, to carry out the public safety mission in a quality work environment. In many public safety agencies, it is the union that provides the institutional stability as elected leaders and appointees come and go. (2) State and local public safety officers play an essential role in the efforts of the United States to detect, prevent, and respond to terrorist attacks, and to respond to natural disasters, hazardous materials, and other mass casualty incidents. State and local public safety officers, as first responders, are a component of our Nation\u2019s National Incident Management System, developed by the Department of Homeland Security to coordinate response to and recovery from terrorism, major natural disasters, and other major emergencies. Public safety employer-employee cooperation is essential in meeting these needs and is, therefore, in the National interest. (3) The Federal Government needs to encourage conciliation, mediation, and arbitration to aid and encourage employers and the representatives of their employees to reach and maintain agreements concerning rates of pay, hours, and working conditions, and to make all reasonable efforts through negotiations to settle their differences by mutual agreement reached through collective bargaining or by such methods as may be provided for in any applicable agreement for the settlement of disputes. (4) The absence of adequate cooperation between public safety employers and employees has implications for the security of employees and can affect interstate and intrastate commerce. The lack of such labor-management cooperation can detrimentally impact the upgrading of law enforcement, fire, and emergency medical services of local communities, the health and well-being of public safety officers, and the morale of law enforcement, fire, and EMS departments. Additionally, these factors could have significant commercial repercussions. Moreover, providing minimal standards for collective bargaining negotiations in the public safety sector can prevent industrial strife between labor and management that interferes with the normal flow of commerce. (5) Many States and localities already provide public safety officers with collective bargaining rights comparable to or greater than the rights and responsibilities set forth in this Act, and such State and local laws should be respected.

R. 4729 To require annual reporting by employers of the number of settlements with employees regarding claims of discrimination on the basis of sex, including verbal and physical sexual harassment, and for other purposes. IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES December 21, 2017 Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney of New York (for herself, Mr. Khanna, Mr. Cummings, Ms. Norton, Ms. Shea-Porter, Mr. Connolly, Mr. David Scott of Georgia, Mr. Raskin, Mr. Suozzi, Ms. Kuster of New Hampshire, Ms. Moore, Mrs. Dingell, and Mr. Pallone) introduced the following bill; which was referred to the Committee on Education and the Workforce A BILL To require annual reporting by employers of the number of settlements with employees regarding claims of discrimination on the basis of sex, including verbal and physical sexual harassment, and for other purposes. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. Short title; Findings. (a) Short title.\u2014This Act may be cited as the \u201cEnding Secrecy About Workplace Sexual Harassment Act\u201d. (b) Findings.\u2014Congress finds that the following: (1) Thirty years after the United States Supreme Court held in Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson that sexual harassment creates a hostile or abusive work environment and is a violation of title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, sexual harassment remains a widespread problem, affecting victims in every industry, at every level of employment. (2) In fiscal year 2015, almost one-third of the 90,000 charges filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission involved harassment, and nearly a quarter of those harassment charges involved sexual harassment. Of the total number of charges received that alleged harassment from employees working for private employers or for State and local government employers, approximately 45 percent alleged harassment on the basis of sex. (3) According to the Commission\u2019s Select Task Force in 2016, on the Study of Harassment in the Workplace, the prevalence of such harassment\u2014 (A) causes mental and physical harm to the victim, as the study concluded that \u201cemployees experiencing sexual harassment are more likely to report symptoms of depression, general stress and anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and overall impaired psychological well-being\u201d; (B) results in harms, which are not limited to victims, as the study concluded that \u201cemployees, female and male alike, who observed hostility directed toward female coworkers (both incivility and sexually harassing behavior) were more likely to experience lower psychological well-being\u201d, which were \u201cin turn linked to lower physical well-being\u201d. (4) Prevalence of sexual harassment in the workplace causes substantial financial harm to victims, as they often try to avoid the harassing behavior by taking leave without pay or leaving the workplace entirely, resulting in a loss of wages. The U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board\u2019s 1995 report on Sexual Harassment in the Federal Workplace found sexual harassment cost Federal employees $4.4 million between 1992 and 1994. (5) According to Commission records, from fiscal year 2010 to 2016, U.S. companies have paid out more than $295 million in public penalties over sexual harassment claims. This sum does not include any private settlements or internally resolved complaints about which there is limited public information. (6) The Commission is responsible for enforcing Federal anti-discrimination laws that protect job applicants and employees, and has the authority to investigate charges of discrimination against employers who are covered by the law. (7) The Commission does not currently receive disclosures from employers on annual EEO\u20131 reports regarding claims of discrimination on the basis of sex, including verbal and physical sexual harassment made directly to the employer and resolved internally through out-of-court settlements or other mediation. SEC. 2. Employer reporting requirement. (a) Reporting requirement.\u2014Every employer required to submit to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission an Employer Information Report EEO\u20131 shall include in such report the number of settlements reached by the employer with an employee in the resolution of claims pertaining to discrimination on the basis of sex, including verbal and physical sexual harassment. (b) Required reporting.\u2014Examples of settlements required to be reported under this section include any agreement where anything of value is conferred to the individual raising the claim in return for such individual declining to further pursue the claim, any internal mediation or other workplace resolution that results in the individual declining to further pursue the claim. (c) Examples of offensive conduct that constitute sexual harassment.\u2014Claims pertaining to sexual harassment are those that complain of acts such as the following\u2014 (1) inappropriate or unwanted touching; (2) verbal comments about sex or of a sexual nature, which may include comments to an individual about her or his body or sexual or romantic activity or the body or sexual or romantic activity of the individual making the comments; (3) referring to another individual by a name or nickname of a romantic, demeaning, or sexual nature; (4) inappropriate gestures of a sexual nature; (5) unwanted proposals for sexual activity; (6) showing another individual photos or other images that are sexually explicit or are otherwise of a sexual nature; or (7) undue attention to or questions about a person\u2019s sexual relationships, sexual history, sexual orientation, or gender identity. SEC. 3. Rights of employees. (a) Protection from retaliation.\u2014 (1) CONDUCT PROHIBITED.\u2014An employer may not terminate any employee nor discriminate against any such employee with regards to terms and conditions of employment because such employee\u2014 (A) inquires about an employer\u2019s meeting of the requirements of this Act; or (B) complains about an employer\u2019s failure to meet the requirements of this Act. (2) ENFORCEMENT.\u2014 (A) LIABILITY.\u2014In addition to civil rights protections and remedies for retaliation available under other Federal, State, or local law, any employer who violates paragraph (1) shall be liable to any eligible employee affected for\u2014 (i) damages equal to the amount of any wages, salary, employment benefits, or other compensation denied or lost to such employee by reason of the violation; (ii) the interest on the amount described in clause (i) calculated at the prevailing rate; (iii) an additional amount as liquidated damages equal to the sum of the amount described in clause (i) and the interest described in clause (ii); and (iv) such equitable relief as may be appropriate, including employment, reinstatement, and promotion. (B) RIGHT OF ACTION.\u2014An action to recover the damages or equitable relief prescribed in subparagraph (1) may be maintained against any employer in any Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction by any one or more employees for and on behalf of\u2014 (i) the employee or employees; or (ii) the employees and other employees similarly situated.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the \u201cWorkplace Action for a Growing Economy Act\u201d or the \u201cWAGE Act\u201d. SEC. 2. Findings. Congress finds the following: (1) The National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.) was enacted to encourage the practice of collective bargaining and to protect the exercise by workers of full freedom of association in the workplace. Since its enactment in 1935, tens of millions of workers have bargained with their employers over wages, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment and have raised the standard of living for all workers. (2) According to research by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, through acting collectively and bargaining with their employers, workers who are unionized earn 25.2 percent more than workers who are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement. They are 40.8 percent more likely to be offered health insurance through work and nearly 5 times as likely to have employer-provided defined benefit pensions. The wage differential is significant for women and people of color. Unionized African-American workers earn 25.1 percent more than African-American workers who are not unionized, and unionized Latino workers earn 45.7 percent more than their peers who are not unionized. Unionized women earn 32.1 percent more than women who are not unionized, and the wage gap between men and women is much smaller at unionized workplaces. The wage gains achieved through collective bargaining agreements benefit workers and their communities. (3) Unions and collective bargaining ensure that productivity gains are shared by working people. The decline in the percentage of workers covered by collective bargaining has contributed significantly to skyrocketing income inequality and flat wages. (4) As enacted in 1935, the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.) protects the right of all workers to join together with their co-workers to advocate for improvements in their pay, benefits, and working conditions, regardless of whether they seek representation by a union. The law protects the right of workers to discuss issues like pay and benefits without retaliation or interference by employers. However, the awareness of workers regarding their rights under the law is lacking, and many employers maintain policies that restrict the ability of workers to discuss workplace issues with each other, directly contravening these rights. Research shows that more than one-half of workers report that their employers have policies that prohibit or discourage workers from discussing pay with their co-workers. These policies and practices impede workers from exercising their rights under the law and impair their freedom of association at work. (5) Retaliation by employers against workers who exercise their rights under the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.) persists at troubling levels. Employers routinely fire workers for trying to form a union at their workplace. In one out of 3 organizing campaigns, one or more workers are discharged for supporting or joining a union. From fiscal years 2014 through 2016, the National Labor Relations Board obtained reinstatement orders for 6,997 workers and obtained awards totaling over $193,000,000 for backpay and other damages for workers who faced illegal retaliation for exercising their rights. (6) The current remedies are inadequate to deter employers from violating the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.). The remedies and penalties for violations of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.) are far weaker than for other labor and employment laws, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000a et seq.). Unlike other major labor and employment laws, there are no civil penalties for violations of the law. Workers cannot go to court to pursue relief on their own; they must rely on the National Labor Relations Board to prosecute their case. (7) Unlike orders of other federal agencies, the National Labor Relations Board\u2019s orders are not enforced until the Board seeks enforcement from the Court of Appeals. As far back as 1969, the Administrative Conference of the United States recognized that the absence of a self-enforcing agency order imposes wasteful delays in the enforcement of the Act, and recommended that the Board\u2019s orders be made self-enforcing like those of other agencies. Congress did not act upon this recommendation, and delays in the Board\u2019s enforcement remain a problem for the Act to be an effective law. (8) Many workers do not currently enjoy the protections of the Act because they are excluded from coverage by the statute or interpretations of the statute. (9) Too often, workers who choose to form unions are frustrated when their employers use delay and other tactics to avoid reaching an initial collective bargaining agreement. Estimates are that in as many as half of new organizing campaigns, workers and their employers fail to reach an initial collective bargaining agreement. (10) In order to make the right to collective bargaining and freedom of association in the workplace a reality for workers, the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 151 et seq.) must be strengthened. SEC. 3. Purposes. The purposes of this Act are to\u2014 (1) strengthen protections for employees engaged in collective action to improve their wages, hours, and terms and conditions of employment; (2) expand coverage under the Act to more employees; (3) provide a process by which workers and employers can successfully negotiate an initial collective bargaining agreement; (4) provide for stronger remedies for employees who face retaliation, discrimination, or other interference with the legal right of the employees to engage in collective action; (5) provide for penalties against employers who violate the rights of employees to engage in collective action, in order to act as a meaningful deterrent against violating the law; and (6) streamline the enforcement procedures of the National Labor Relations Board to provide for more timely and effective enforcement of the law. SEC. 4. Strengthening remedies and enforcement for employees exercising their rights at work.

Such penalty shall be in an amount not to exceed $50,000 for each violation, except that the Board shall double the amount of such penalty, to an amount not to exceed $100,000, in any case where the employer has within the preceding 5 years committed another such violation. \u201c(2) CONSIDERATIONS.\u2014In determining the amount of any civil penalty under this subsection, the Board shall consider\u2014 \u201c(A) the gravity of the unfair labor practice; \u201c(B) the impact of the unfair labor practice on the charging party, on other persons seeking to exercise rights guaranteed by this Act, and on the public interest; and \u201c(C) the size of the employer. \u201c(3) DIRECTOR AND OFFICER LIABILITY.\u2014If the Board determines, based on the particular facts and circumstances presented, that a director or officer\u2019s personal liability is warranted, a civil penalty for a violation described in this subsection may also be assessed against any director or officer of the employer who directed or committed the violation, had established a policy that led to such violations, or had knowledge of and the authority to prevent the violation and failed to do so. \u201c(d) Joint and several liability.\u2014An employer shall be jointly and severally liable under this Act for any violations of this Act involving one or more employees supplied by another employer to perform labor within the employer\u2019s usual course of business.\u201d.

If, after such investigation, the officer or regional attorney to whom the matter may be referred has reasonable cause to believe such charge is true and that a complaint should issue, he shall bring a petition for appropriate temporary relief or restraining order as set forth in paragraph (1). The district court shall grant the relief requested unless the court concludes that there is no reasonable likelihood that the Board will succeed on the merits of the Board\u2019s claim.\u201d. (d) Private enforcement.\u2014 (1) RIGHT TO CIVIL ACTION.\u2014Section 12 of the National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 162), as amended by subsection (b), is further amended by adding at the end the following: \u201c(e) Right to civil action.\u2014 \u201c(1) IN GENERAL.\u2014Any person who is injured by reason of any violation of paragraph (1) or (3) of section 8(a) may, in addition to or in lieu of filing a charge alleging such unfair labor practice with the Board in accordance with this Act, bring a civil action in the appropriate district court of the United States against the employer within 180 days of the violation. \u201c(2) AVAILABLE RELIEF.\u2014Relief granted in an action under paragraph (1) may include any relief authorized by section 706(g) of the Civil Rights Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 2000e\u20135(g) or by section 1977A(b) of the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. 1981a(b))). \u201c(3) ATTORNEY\u2019S FEE.\u2014In any action or proceeding under this subsection, the court may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee (including expert fees) as part of the costs.\u201d.

R. 4505 To amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to establish a minimum salary threshold for bona fide executive, administrative, and professional employees exempt from Federal overtime compensation requirements, and automatically update such threshold every 3 years.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, SECTION 1. Short title. This Act may be cited as the \u201cRestoring Overtime Pay Act of 2017\u201d. SEC. 2. Findings. Congress finds the following: (1) The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) established overtime compensation requirements for certain employees when they work more than 40 hours in a given workweek. (2) Under section 13(a)(1) of such Act, Congress delegated to the Secretary of Labor the authority to define and delimit the terms relating to the exemption for bona fide executive, administrative, and professional employees (commonly known as the \u201cwhite collar exemption\u201d). (3) For more than 75 years, the Secretary of Labor has exercised its delegated authority to issue regulations that define and delimit the terms relating to the white collar exemption by applying a duties test and applying a minimum compensation level (or salary threshold). (4) The Secretary of Labor began utilizing a salary threshold in the initial regulations defining and delimiting the terms relating to the white collar exemption, which were first issued in 1938. (5) Congress has long approved the use of a salary threshold by the Secretary of Labor, as demonstrated by the fact that Congress has amended the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 at least 10 times since 1938 and has not precluded the Secretary from using a salary threshold. (6) The salary threshold became woefully out of date and ineffective as a result of not being sufficiently updated to keep pace with a changing economy, as evidenced by the fact that more than 60 percent of all full-time salaried workers earned less than the salary threshold in 1975 and less than 7 percent of these workers earned less than the salary threshold in 2016. (7) The salary threshold of $455 per week, or $23,660 per year, that was in effect on May 22, 2016, was below the poverty line for a family of 4. (8) The Secretary of Labor updated the salary threshold on May 23, 2016, through a final rule entitled \u201cDefining and Delimiting the Exemptions for Executive, Administrative, Professional, Outside Sales and Computer Employees\u201d (81 Fed. Reg. 32391) by increasing the salary threshold to the 40th percentile of earnings of full-time salaried employees in the lowest-wage Census Region, resulting in a salary threshold of $913 per week or $47,476 per year. (9) The final rule would benefit more than 13,000,000 employees by providing overtime compensation protections to 4,200,000 new employees and strengthening overtime compensation protections for 8,900,000 additional employees. (10) The Secretary of Labor went through a thorough process in crafting the final rule, seeking public input and conducting extensive economic analysis, including\u2014 (A) spending more than a year meeting with more than 200 interested parties to obtain input before issuing the proposed rule in 2015; (B) considering more than 270,000 comments received during the 60-day public comment period on the proposed rule; and (C) making significant changes in response to public input before issuing the final rule. (11) The public comments submitted to the Secretary of Labor regarding the proposed rule were overwhelmingly positive and supportive of the rule. (12) The increase in the salary threshold, included in the final rule, to the 40th percentile of earnings of full-time salaried employees in the lowest-wage Census Region, resulting in a threshold of $913 per week or $47,476 per year, was a strong yet measured increase by almost any measure, including as compared to\u2014 (A) the higher salary threshold of $970 per week or $50,440 per year, initially put forward by the Secretary of Labor in the proposed rule; (B) the salary threshold of $984 per week or $51,168 per year, which would have fully accounted for the erosion to the value of the salary threshold since 1975 due to inflation; (C) the salary threshold of $1,122 per week or $58,344 per year, which would have covered the same share of all salaried workers as were covered in 1975 after adjusting for the different educational composition of the workforce today; and (D) the salary threshold of $1,327 per week or $69,004 per year, which would have covered the same percentage of all salaried workers as were covered in 1975 without adjusting for the different educational composition of the workforce today. (13) The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas erroneously called the authority of the Secretary of Labor under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 into question when it issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the Department of Labor from enforcing the final overtime rule.
