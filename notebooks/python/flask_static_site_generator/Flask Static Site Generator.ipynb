    "# Creating a Static Site Generator with Flask\n",
    "A static site is one that has no interactive capabilities; it is simply a collection of one or more HTML documents that are linked together. While limited in functionality, a static site may be all that is necessary. This blog, itself, is a static site and it was created by the very process I am about to outline. \n",
    "\n",
    "I decided just a couple of weeks before making this post that I wanted to create a blog that would serve as a creative outlet for me while also showcasing my knowledge and abilities. Upon an initial search for ideas on how I should go about creating this blog, I stubbled upon <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\">GitHub Pages</a> which allows GitHub users to create static pages that are hosted from a special repository named <code>&lt;your_username&gt;.github.io</code>. This is great because it allows GitHub users to easily serve up new content with a simple <code>git push</code> command without having to find a hosting service.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step for me was then to figure out how to setup a process by which I could create new content and quickly integrate it with my existing blog. \n",
    "\n",
    "<h3><b>Enter the static site generator.</b></h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "Static site generators leverage the templating capability of a dynamic site's server in order to produce a set of static resources that have uniformity of stylization without requiring you to copy and paste the same navigation bar, side bar, footer, etc. over and over again. There are a multitude of options when it comes to selecting a static site generator. Built with Ruby, <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\">Jekyll</a> is one of the most popular and is the recommended generator for GitHub Pages by GitHub itself. Another I had considered was <a href=\"https://blog.getpelican.com/\">Pelican</a> which is built with Python. After an initial survey of my options, I decided that none of them fit my needs which were to have a simple yet customizable generator that was not opinionated about the layout of the blog.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was at this point when I realized that I should just use Flask to render Jinja templates with HTML created by converting Jupyter notebooks containing my blog content. I knew immediately that this was the best way for me but wasn't quite sure how to go about it best. Thankfully, Nicolas Perriault has an <a href=\"https://nicolas.perriault.net/code/2012/dead-easy-yet-powerful-static-website-generator-with-flask/\">excellent blog post</a> on how to easily achieve exactly what I want.\n",

    "First of all, I'll provide a link to my <a href=\"https://github.com/a-rich/a-rich.github.io\">repository</a> which houses this blog. We'll be focusing on <a href=\"https://github.com/a-rich/a-rich.github.io/blob/master/convert.py\">convert.py</a> for turning Jupyter notebooks into blog post content and <a href=\"https://github.com/a-rich/a-rich.github.io/blob/master/sitebuilder.py\">sitebuilder.py</a> for the creation of the static resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process for creating a new blog post is started by filling out a Jupyter notebook before converting that into HTML and using BeautifulSoup to clean it up and insert Bootstrap css. The resulting HTML document is stored in a particular directory which <a href=\"https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-FlatPages/https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-FlatPages/\"><code>Flask-FlatPages</code></a> references to load it. The Flask application in <code>sitebuilder.py</code> has an index route used to generate a link for every blog post, about page, and topic page captured by FlatPages. The application also has a page route that's hit by every link generated by the index route. The page route renders one of three templates depending on the <code>path</code> URL parameter. The final step is to take a snapshot of the page/link graph that is the blog site using <a href=\"https://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/\"><code>Frozen-Flask</code></a>. All of this combined enables a one command pipeline from Jupyter notebook to updated blog site."
