<p class="my-3">I am a data scientist and software engineer with multiple years of
experience applying research-oriented problem solving skills across the domains
of neurological simulation, data mining, and deep learning. I'm currently
seeking opportunities to advance my Python data science skills further. My
dream job is to apply machine learning to human brain data in order to build a
chronic, high-fidelity brain-computer interface.</p>
