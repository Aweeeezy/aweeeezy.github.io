<h4 class="font-weight-bold" id="Creating-a-Static-Site-Generator-with-Flask">Creating a Static Site Generator with Flask</h4><p>A static site is one that has no interactive capabilities; it is simply a collection of one or more HTML documents that are linked together. While limited in functionality, a static site may be all that is necessary. This blog, itself, is a static site and it was created by the very process I am about to outline.</p>
<p>I decided just a couple of weeks before making this post that I wanted to create a blog that would serve as a creative outlet for me while also showcasing my knowledge and abilities. Upon an initial search for ideas on how I should go about creating this blog, I stubbled upon <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> which allows GitHub users to create static pages that are hosted from a special repository named <code>&lt;your_username&gt;.github.io</code>. This is great because it allows GitHub users to easily serve up new content with a simple <code>git push</code> command without having to find a hosting service.</p>
<p>The next step for me was then to figure out how to setup a process by which I could create new content and quickly integrate it with my existing blog.</p>
<h6 class="font-weight-bold"><b>Enter the static site generator.</b></h6><p>Static site generators leverage the templating capability of a dynamic site's server in order to produce a set of static resources that have uniformity of stylization without requiring you to copy and paste the same navigation bar, side bar, footer, etc. over and over again. There are a multitude of options when it comes to selecting a static site generator. Built with Ruby, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> is one of the most popular and is the recommended generator for GitHub Pages by GitHub itself. Another I had considered was <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a> which is built with Python. After an initial survey of my options, I decided that none of them fit my needs which were to have a simple yet customizable generator that was not opinionated about the layout of the blog.</p>
<p>It was at this point when I realized that I should just use Flask to render Jinja templates with HTML created by converting Jupyter notebooks containing my blog content. I knew immediately that this was the best way for me but wasn't quite sure how to go about it best. Thankfully, Nicolas Perriault has an <a href="https://nicolas.perriault.net/code/2012/dead-easy-yet-powerful-static-website-generator-with-flask/">excellent blog post</a> on how to easily achieve exactly what I want.</p>
<p>Here I'll summarize the key points in his blog post and detail the adaptations I made to adhere to my needs.</p>

<h5 class="font-weight-bold" id="My-GitHub-Pages-User-Page">My GitHub Pages User Page</h5><p>First of all, I'll link you to my <a href="https://github.com/a-rich/a-rich.github.io">repository</a> which houses this blog. We'll be focusing on <a href="https://github.com/a-rich/a-rich.github.io/blob/master/convert.py">convert.py</a> for turning Jupyter notebooks into blog post content and <a href="https://github.com/a-rich/a-rich.github.io/blob/master/sitebuilder.py">sitebuilder.py</a> for the creation of the static resources.</p>
<p>The overall process for creating a new blog post is started by filling out a Jupyter notebook, then converting that into HTML and using BeautifulSoup to clean it up and insert Bootstrap css. The resulting HTML document is stored in a particular directory which <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-FlatPages/https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-FlatPages/"><code>Flask-FlatPages</code></a> uses to load them. The Flask application in <code>sitebuilder.py</code> has an index route and template used to generate a link for every blog post and each and a page route. The final step is to take a snapshot of the page/link graph that is my blog site using <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/"><code>Frozen-Flask</code></a>.</p>
